title: Bayes correlated equilibria, no-regret dynamics in Bayesian games, and the
  price of anarchy
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper investigates equilibrium computation and the price of anarchy
  for Bayesian games, which are the fundamental models of games with incomplete information.
  In normal-form games with complete information, it is known that efficiently computable
  no-regret dynamics converge to correlated equilibria, and the price of anarchy for
  correlated equilibria can be bounded for a broad class of games called smooth games.
  However, in Bayesian games, as surveyed by Forges (1993), several non-equivalent
  extensions of correlated equilibria exist, and it remains unclear whether they can
  be efficiently computed or whether their price of anarchy can be bounded. In this
  paper, we identify a natural extension of correlated equilibria that can be computed
  efficiently and is guaranteed to have bounds on the price of anarchy in various
  games. First, we propose a variant of regret called untruthful swap regret. If each
  player minimizes it in repeated play of Bayesian games, the empirical distribution
  of these dynamics is guaranteed to converge to communication equilibria, which is
  one of the extensions of correlated equilibria proposed by Myerson (1982). We present
  an efficient algorithm for minimizing untruthful swap regret with a sublinear upper
  bound, which we prove to be tight in terms of the number of types. As a result,
  by simulating the dynamics with our algorithm, we can approximately compute a communication
  equilibrium in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend existing lower bounds on
  the price of anarchy based on the smoothness arguments from Bayesâ€“Nash equilibria
  to equilibria obtained by the proposed dynamics.
