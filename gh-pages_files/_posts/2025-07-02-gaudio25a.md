title: "“All-Something-Nothing” Phase Transitions in Planted $k$-Factor Recovery (Extended
  Abstract)"
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of inferring a $k$-factor, specifically
  a spanning $k$-regular graph, planted within an Erdős–Rényi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,\lambda/n)$.
  We uncover an interesting “all-something-nothing” phase transition. Specifically,
  we show that as the average degree $\lambda$ surpasses the critical threshold of
  $1/k$, the inference problem undergoes a transition from almost exact recovery (“all”
  phase) to partial recovery (“something” phase). Moreover, as $\lambda$ tends to
  infinity, the accuracy of recovery diminishes to zero, leading to the onset of the
  “nothing” phase. This finding complements the recent result by Mossel, Niles-Weed,
  Sohn, Sun, and Zadik who established that for certain sufficiently dense graphs,
  the problem undergoes an “all-or-nothing” phase transition, jumping from near-perfect
  to near-zero recovery. In addition, we characterize the recovery accuracy of a linear-time
  iterative pruning algorithm and show that it achieves almost exact recovery when
  $\lambda < 1/k$. A key component of our analysis is a two-step cycle construction:
  we first build trees through local neighborhood exploration and then connect them
  by sprinkling using reserved edges. Interestingly, for proving impossibility of
  almost exact recovery, we construct $\Theta(n)$ many small trees of size $\Theta(1)$,
  whereas for establishing the algorithmic lower bound, a single large tree of size
  $\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})$ suffices.'
