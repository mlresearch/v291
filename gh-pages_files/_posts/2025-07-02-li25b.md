title: Some easy optimization problems have the overlap-gap property
section: Original Papers
abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property
  in (i) sparse $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential
  edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ graphs,
  shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform
  approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the
  first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic
  intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.
