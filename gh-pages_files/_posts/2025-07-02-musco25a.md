title: Sharper Bounds for Chebyshev Moment Matching, with Applications
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the problem of approximately recovering a probability distribution
  given noisy measurements of its Chebyshev polynomial moments. This problem arises
  broadly across algorithms, statistics, and machine learning.  By leveraging a \emph{global
  decay bound} on the coefficients in the Chebyshev expansion of any Lipschitz function,
  we sharpen prior work, proving that accurate recovery in the Wasserstein distance
  is possible with more noise than previously known. Our result immediately yields
  a number of applications: (1) We give a simple “linear query” algorithm for constructing
  a differentially private synthetic data distribution with Wasserstein-$1$ error
  $\tilde{O}(1/n)$ based on a dataset of $n$ points in $[-1,1]$. This bound is optimal
  up to log factors and matches a recent breakthrough of Boedihardjo, Strohmer, and
  Vershynin [Probab. Theory. Rel., 2024], which uses a more complex “superregular
  random walk” method to beat an $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ accuracy barrier inherent to earlier
  approaches. (2) We give an $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon)$ time algorithm for the linear
  algebraic problem of estimating the spectral density of an $n\times n$ symmetric
  matrix up to $\epsilon$ error in the Wasserstein distance. Our result accelerates
  prior methods from  Chen et al. [ICML 2021] and Braverman et al. [STOC 2022]. (3)
  We tighten an analysis of Vinayak, Kong, Valiant, and Kakade [ICML 2019] on the
  maximum likelihood estimator for the statistical problem of “Learning Populations
  of Parameters”, extending the parameter regime in which sample optimal results can
  be obtained. Beyond these main results, we provide an extension of our bound to
  estimating distributions in $d > 1$ dimensions. We hope that these bounds will find
  applications more broadly to problems involving distribution recovery from noisy
  moment information.'
