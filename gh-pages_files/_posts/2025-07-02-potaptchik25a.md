title: Linear Convergence of Diffusion Models Under the Manifold Hypothesis
section: Original Papers
abstract: Score-matching generative models have proven successful at sampling from
  complex high-dimensional data distributions. In many applications, this distribution
  is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into
  $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known
  convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$.
  The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the
  best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in
  order to converge in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic
  terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency
  is sharp.
