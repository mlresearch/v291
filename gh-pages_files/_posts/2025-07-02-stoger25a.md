abstract: 'For the problem of reconstructing  a low-rank matrix from a few linear
  measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature:
  convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches
  that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions,  it
  is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the
  number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth.
  In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive,  existing
  recovery guarantees assume  that the number of samples scales at least quadratically
  with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by
  showing that  the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization
  in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing
  a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements.  We show that factorized
  gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with
  a linear rate  as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$,
  where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth
  matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex
  matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic
  decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly
  dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that
  our proof technique will be of independent interest to other non-convex problems.'
