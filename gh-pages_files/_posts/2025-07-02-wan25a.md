title: Black-Box Reductions for Decentralized Online Convex Optimization in Changing
  Environments
section: Original Papers
abstract: We investigate decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO) in changing
  environments, and choose adaptive regret and dynamic regret as the performance metric.
  Specifically, these two metrics compare each local learner against the optimal comparator
  over every interval, and any sequence of comparators over all rounds, respectively.
  It is well-known that in the centralized setting, plenty of algorithms with (nearly)
  optimal bounds on these two metrics have been proposed. However, none of them has
  been extended into D-OCO, possibly due to the difficulty in handling their commonly
  used two-level structure. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose black-box reductions
  from minimizing these two metrics of D-OCO to minimizing them in the centralized
  setting. Let $n$, $\rho$, and $T$ denote the number of local learners, the spectral
  gap of the communication matrix, and the time horizon, respectively. For adaptive
  regret, our reduction can achieve an $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{\tau}\log T)$
  bound over any interval of length $\tau$ in general, and an improved one of $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/2}(\log
  T)^3)$ when facing strongly convex functions. These two bounds match existing lower
  bounds up to polylogarithmic factors. For dynamic regret, our reduction can achieve
  an $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T(1+P_T)\log T})$ bound in general, where $P_T$
  is the path-length of comparators. We also provide the first lower bound for dynamic
  regret of D-OCO to demonstrate that our dynamic regret is nearly optimal.
