title: 'Depth Separations in Neural Networks: Separating the Dimension from the Accuracy'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We prove an exponential separation between depth 2 and depth 3 neural networks,
  when approximating a $\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz target function to constant accuracy,
  with respect to a distribution with support in the unit ball, under the mild assumption
  that the weights of the depth 2 network are exponentially bounded. This resolves
  an open problem posed in Safran et al. (2019), and proves that the curse of dimensionality
  manifests itself in depth 2 approximation, even in cases where the target function
  can be represented efficiently using a depth 3 network. Previously, lower bounds
  that were used to separate depth 2 from depth 3 networks required that at least
  one of the Lipschitz constant, target accuracy or (some measure of) the size of
  the domain of approximation scale \emph{polynomially} with the input dimension,
  whereas in our result these parameters are fixed to be \emph{constants} independent
  of the input dimension: our parameters are simultaneously optimal. Our lower bound
  holds for a wide variety of activation functions, and is based on a novel application
  of a worst- to average-case random self-reducibility argument, allowing us to leverage
  depth 2 threshold circuits lower bounds in a new domain.'
