title: Improved algorithms for learning quantum Hamiltonians, via flat polynomials
section: Original Papers
abstract: We give an improved algorithm for learning a quantum Hamiltonian given copies
  of its Gibbs state, that can succeed at any temperature. Specifically, we improve
  over the work of Bakshi, Liu, Moitra, and Tang (2024) by reducing the sample complexity
  and runtime dependence to singly exponential in the inverse-temperature parameter,
  as opposed to doubly exponential. Our main technical contribution is a new flat
  polynomial approximation to the exponential function, with significantly lower degree
  than the flat polynomial approximation used in Bakshi et al.
