  Learning'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) in large state spaces crucially
  rely on supervised learning subroutines to estimate objects such as value functions
  or transition probabilities. Since only the simplest supervised learning problems
  can be solved provably and efficiently, practical performance of an RL algorithm
  depends on which of these supervised learning “oracles” it assumes access to (and
  how they are implemented). But which oracles are better or worse? Is there a \emph{minimal}
  oracle? In this work, we clarify the impact of the choice of supervised learning
  oracle on the computational complexity of RL, as quantified by the oracle strength.
  First, for the task of reward-free exploration in Block MDPs in the standard episodic
  access model—a ubiquitous setting for RL with function approximation—we identify
  \emph{two-context regression} as a minimal oracle, i.e. an oracle that is both necessary
  and sufficient (under a mild regularity assumption). Second, we identify \emph{one-context
  regression} as a near-minimal oracle in the stronger \emph{reset} access model,
  establishing a provable computational benefit of resets in the process. Third, we
  broaden our focus to \emph{Low-Rank MDPs}, where we give cryptographic evidence
  that the analogous oracle from the Block MDP setting is insufficient.
