title: Are all models wrong? Fundamental limits in distribution-free empirical model
  falsification
section: Original Papers
abstract: In statistics and machine learning, when we train a fitted model on available
  data, we typically want to ensure that we are searching within a model class that
  contains at least one accurate model—that is, we would like to ensure an upper bound
  on the \emph{model class risk} (the lowest possible risk that can be attained by
  any model in the class). However, it is also of interest to establish lower bounds
  on the model class risk, for instance so that we can determine whether our fitted
  model is at least approximately optimal within the class, or, so that we can decide
  whether the model class is unsuitable for the particular task at hand.  Particularly
  in the setting of interpolation learning where machine learning models are trained
  to reach zero error on the training data, we might ask if, at the very least, a
  positive lower bound on the model class risk is possible—or are we unable to detect
  that “all models are wrong”? In this work, we answer these questions in a distribution-free
  setting by establishing a model-agnostic, fundamental hardness result for the problem
  of constructing a lower bound on the best test error achievable over a model class,
  and examine its implications on specific model classes such as tree-based methods
  and linear regression.
