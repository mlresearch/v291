title: A Proof of The Changepoint Detection Threshold Conjecture in Preferential Attachment
  Models
section: Original Papers
abstract: We investigate the problem of detecting and estimating a changepoint in
  the attachment function of a network evolving according to a preferential attachment
  model on  $n$ vertices, using only a single final snapshot of the network. Bet et
  al. (2023) show that a simple test based on thresholding the number of vertices
  with minimum degrees can detect the changepoint when the change occurs at time $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.
  They further make the striking conjecture that detection becomes impossible for
  any test if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$  Kaddouri et al. (2024) make
  a step forward by proving the detection is impossible if the change occurs at time
  $n-o(n^{1/3}).$ In this paper, we resolve the conjecture affirmatively,  proving
  that detection is indeed impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$  Furthermore,
  we establish that estimating the changepoint with an error smaller than $o(\sqrt{n})$
  is also impossible, thereby confirming that the estimator proposed in Bhamidi et
  al. (2018) is order-optimal.
