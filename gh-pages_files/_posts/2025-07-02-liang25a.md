title: 'Low-dimensional adaptation of diffusion models: Convergence in total variation
  (extended abstract)'
section: Original Papers
abstract: " This paper presents new theoretical insights into how diffusion generative
  models adapt to low-dimensional structure in data distributions. We study two widely
  used samplers — the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and the denoising
  diffusion implicit model (DDIM) — and analyze their convergence behavior under the
  assumption of accurate score estimates. Our main result shows that both DDPM and
  DDIM require at most $O(k/\\varepsilon)$ iterations (up to logarithmic factors)
  to generate samples that are $\\varepsilon$-close to the target distribution in
  total variation distance, where $k$ captures an intrinsic low-dimensional structure
  of the distribution. Importantly, our theory holds without assuming smoothness or
  log-concavity. These results provide the first rigorous guarantees for the low-dimensional
  adaptation capability of DDIM-type samplers, and significantly improve upon prior
  TV-based convergence bounds for DDPM. Our analysis also highlights the role of discretization
  coefficients in exploiting low-dimensional structure, and establishes lower bounds
  that justify the optimality of commonly used parameter choices originally proposed
  by Ho et al. (2020); Song et al. (2020). "
