title: Mean-field analysis of polynomial-width two-layer neural network beyond finite
  time horizon
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width
  neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected
  gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to tightly
  bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed by the mean-field
  dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is the local Hessian of
  each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle’s velocity in the mean-
  field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our results to the canonical
  feature learning problem of estimating a well-specified single-index model; we permit
  the information exponent to be arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that
  grow polynomially in the ambient dimension d. We show that, due to a certain "self-concordance"
  property in these problems - where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded by
  a constant times the particle’s velocity - polynomially many neurons are sufficient
  to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.
