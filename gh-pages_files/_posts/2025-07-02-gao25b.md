title: Computing High-dimensional Confidence Sets for Arbitrary Distributions
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of learning a high-density region of an arbitrary distribution
  over $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a target coverage parameter $\delta$, and sample access
  to an arbitrary distribution $\mathcal{D}$, we want to output a confidence set $S
  \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\delta$ coverage of $\mathcal{D}$,
  i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{y \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ y \in S \right] \ge \delta$, and the
  volume of $S$ is as small as possible. This is a central problem in high-dimensional
  statistics with applications in high-dimensional analogues of finding confidence
  intervals, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.  In the most general
  setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we restrict our attention
  to competing with sets from a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ with bounded VC-dimension.
  An algorithm for learning confidence sets is competitive with class $\mathcal{C}$
  if, given samples from an arbitrary distribution $\mathcal{D}$, it outputs in polynomial
  time a set that achieves $\delta$ coverage of $\mathcal{D}$, and whose volume is
  competitive with the smallest set in $\mathcal{C}$ with the required coverage $\delta$.
  This problem is computationally challenging even in the basic setting when $\mathcal{C}$
  is the set of all Euclidean balls.  Existing algorithms based on coresets find in
  polynomial time a ball whose volume is  $\exp(\tilde{O}( d/ \log d))$-factor competitive
  with the volume of the best ball.   Our main result is an algorithm that finds a
  confidence set whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1/2}))$ factor competitive with
  the optimal ball having the desired coverage. It is surprisingly simple and also
  extends to finding confidence sets competitive against unions of $k$ balls, and
  improved guarantees under additional assumptions.  The algorithm is improper (it
  outputs an ellipsoid). Combined with our computational intractability result for
  proper learning balls within an $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor
  in volume, our results provide an interesting separation between proper and (improper)
  learning of confidence sets.
