title: Efficient Near-Optimal Algorithm for Online Shortest Paths in Directed Acyclic
  Graphs with Bandit Feedback Against Adaptive Adversaries
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this paper, we study the online shortest path problem in directed acyclic
  graphs (DAGs) under bandit feedback against an adaptive adversary. Given a DAG $G
  = (V, E)$ with a source node $v_{\mathsf{s}}$ and a sink node $v_{\mathsf{t}}$,
  let $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \{0,1\}^{|E|}$ denote the set of all paths from $v_{\mathsf{s}}$
  to $v_{\mathsf{t}}$. At each round $t$, we select a path $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathcal{X}$
  and receive bandit feedback on our loss $⟨\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}_t ⟩\in [-1,1]$,
  where $\mathbf{y}_t$ is an adversarially chosen loss vector. Our goal is to minimize
  regret with respect to the best path in hindsight over $T$ rounds. We propose the
  first computationally efficient algorithm to achieve a near-minimax optimal regret
  bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{|E|T\log |\mathcal{X}|})$ with high probability
  against any adaptive adversary, where $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic
  factors in the number of edges $|E|$. Our algorithm leverages a novel loss estimator
  and a centroid-based decomposition in a nontrivial manner to attain this regret
  bound. As an application, we show that our algorithm for DAGs provides state-of-the-art
  efficient algorithms for $m$-sets, extensive-form games, the Colonel Blotto game,
  shortest walks in directed graphs, hypercubes, and multi-task multi-armed bandits,
  achieving improved high-probability regret guarantees in all these settings.
