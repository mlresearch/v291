title: Optimal Online Bookmaking for Any Number of Outcomes
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the \emph{Online Bookmaking} problem, where a bookmaker dynamically
  updates betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round,
  the bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of gamblers,
  aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show that for any
  event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting over all possible
  gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker’s optimal loss is the largest root
  of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that bookmakers can be as fair as desired
  while avoiding financial risk, and the explicit characterization reveals an intriguing
  relation between the bookmaker’s regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient
  algorithm that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal
  gambler, the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler
  is suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the \emph{optimal opportunistic}
  loss, a notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
  contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the \emph{Bellman-Pareto
  frontier}, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for Bellman’s value function
  with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the Pareto frontier in the context
  of vector repeated games.'
