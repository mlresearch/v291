title: What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and Estimators
  Beyond Unconfoundedness (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the \emph{average treatment effect}
  (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of \emph{unconfoundedness} and
  \emph{overlap}. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for
  all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence
  of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types
  of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational
  studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity
  designs - violate overlap. In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions
  that enable the \emph{identification} of the average treatment effect, extending
  beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of {statistical}
  learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and nearly
  necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition characterizes
  the identification of the \emph{average treatment effect on the treated} (ATT) and
  can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility
  of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition
  is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior
  works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions,
  this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression
  Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For
  each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions,
  ATE can be estimated from finite samples. We believe these findings open new avenues
  for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly
  in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.
