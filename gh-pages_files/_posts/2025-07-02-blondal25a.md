title: Stability and List-Replicability for Agnostic Learners
section: Original Papers
abstract: Two seminal papers–Alon, Livni, Malliaris, Moran (STOC 2019)  and Bun, Livni,
  and Moran (FOCS 2020)–established the equivalence between online learnability and
  globally stable PAC learnability in binary classification.  However, Chase, Chornomaz,
  Moran, and Yehudayoff (STOC 2024) recently showed that this equivalence does not
  hold in the agnostic setting. Specifically, they proved that in the agnostic setting,
  only finite hypothesis classes are globally stable learnable. Therefore, agnostic
  global stability is too restrictive to capture interesting hypothesis classes.  To
  address this limitation, Chase \emph{et al.} introduced two relaxations of agnostic
  global stability.  In this paper, we characterize the classes that are learnable
  under their proposed relaxed conditions, resolving the two open problems raised
  in their work. First, we prove that in the setting where the stability parameter
  can depend on the excess error (the gap between the learner’s error and the best
  achievable error by the hypothesis class), agnostic stability is fully characterized
  by the Littlestone dimension. Consequently, as in the realizable case, this form
  of learnability is equivalent to online learnability. As part of the proof of this
  theorem, we strengthen the celebrated result of Bun \emph{et al.} by showing that
  classes with infinite Littlestone dimension are not stably PAC learnable, even if
  we allow the stability parameter to depend on the excess error. For the second relaxation
  proposed by Chase \emph{et al.}, we prove that only finite hypothesis classes are
  globally stable learnable even if we restrict the agnostic setting to distributions
  with small population loss.
