title: 'A Gap Between the Gaussian RKHS and Neural Networks: An Infinite-Center Asymptotic
  Analysis'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width
  bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type
  space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate
  function spaces, including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces.
  Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity,
  such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established
  that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this
  Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural
  network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded
  domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish
  the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS
  have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial
  gap between kernel methods and neural networks by exhibiting functions that kernel
  methods easily represent, whereas neural networks cannot.'
