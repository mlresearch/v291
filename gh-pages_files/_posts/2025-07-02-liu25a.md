section: Original Papers
abstract: Recent work by Foster et al. (2021, 2022, 2023b) and Xu and Zeevi (2023)
  developed the framework of decision estimation coefficient (DEC) that characterizes
  the complexity of general online decision making problems and provides a general
  algorithm design principle. These works, however, either focus on the pure stochastic
  regime where the world remains fixed over time, or the pure adversarial regime where
  the world arbitrarily changes over time. For the hybrid regime where the dynamics
  of the world is fixed while the reward arbitrarily changes, they only give pessimistic
  bounds on the decision complexity. In this work, we propose a general extension
  of DEC that more precisely characterizes this case. Besides applications in special
  cases, our framework leads to a flexible algorithm design where the learner learns
  over subsets of the hypothesis set, trading estimation complexity with decision
  complexity, which could be of independent interest. Our work covers model-based
  learning and model-free learning in the hybrid regime, with a newly proposed extension
  of the bilinear classes (Du et al., 2021) to the adversarial-reward case. In addition,
  our method improves the best-known regret bounds for linear $Q^\star/V^\star$ MDPs
  in the pure stochastic regime.
