title: Learning Mixtures of Gaussians Using Diffusion Models
section: Original Papers
abstract: We give a new algorithm for learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians (with identity
  covariance in $\mathbb{R}^n$) to TV error $\varepsilon$, with quasi-polynomial ($O(n^{\text{poly\,log}\left(\frac{n+k}{\varepsilon}\right)})$)
  time and sample complexity, under a minimum weight assumption. Our results extend
  to continuous mixtures of Gaussians where the mixing distribution is supported on
  a union of $k$ balls of constant radius. In particular, this applies to the case
  of Gaussian convolutions of distributions on low-dimensional manifolds, or more
  generally sets with small covering number, for which no sub-exponential algorithm
  was previously known. Unlike previous approaches, most of which are algebraic in
  nature, our approach is analytic and relies on the framework of diffusion models.      Diffusion
  models are a modern paradigm for generative modeling, which typically rely on learning
  the score function (gradient log-pdf) along a process transforming a pure noise
  distribution, in our case a Gaussian, to the data distribution.  Despite their dazzling
  performance in tasks such as image generation, there are few end-to-end theoretical
  guarantees that they can efficiently learn nontrivial families of distributions;
  we give some of the first such guarantees. We proceed by deriving higher-order Gaussian
  noise sensitivity bounds for the score functions for a Gaussian mixture to show
  that that they can be inductively learned using piecewise polynomial regression
  (up to poly-logarithmic degree), and combine this with known convergence results
  for diffusion models.
