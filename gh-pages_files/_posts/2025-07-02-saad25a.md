title: New Lower Bounds for Non-Convex Stochastic Optimization through Divergence
  Decomposition
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study fundamental limits of first\hyp order stochastic optimization in
  a range of non\hyp convex settings, including $L$-smooth functions satisfying Quasar\hyp
  Convexity ({QC}), Quadratic Growth ({QG}), and Restricted Secant Inequalities ({RSI}).
  While the convergence properties of standard algorithms are well understood in deterministic
  regimes, significantly fewer results address the stochastic case, where only unbiased
  and noisy gradients are available. We establish new lower bounds on the number of
  noisy gradient queries to minimize these classes of functions, also showing that
  they are tight (up to a logarithmic factor) in all the relevant quantities characterizing
  each class. Our approach reformulates the optimization task as a function identification
  problem, leveraging \textit{divergence decomposition} arguments to construct a challenging
  subclass that leads to sharp lower bounds. Furthermore, we present a specialized
  algorithm in the one\hyp dimensional setting that achieves faster rates, suggesting
  that certain dimensional thresholds are intrinsic to the complexity of non\hyp convex
  stochastic optimization.
