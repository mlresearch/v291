title: Trade-offs in Data Memorization via Strong Data Processing Inequalities
section: Original Papers
abstract: Recent research demonstrated that training large language models involves
  memorization of a significant fraction of training data. Such memorization can lead
  to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus motivates the
  study of data memorizationâ€™s role in learning. In this work, we develop a general
  approach for proving lower bounds on excess data memorization, that relies on a
  new connection between strong data processing inequalities and data memorization.
  We then demonstrate that several simple and natural binary classification problems
  exhibit a trade-off between the number of samples available to a learning algorithm,
  and the amount of information about the training data that a learning algorithm
  needs to memorize to be accurate. In particular, $\Omega(d)$ bits of information
  about the training data need to be memorized when $O(1)$ $d$-dimensional examples
  are available, which then decays as the number of examples grows at a problem-specific
  rate. Further, our lower bounds are generally matched (up to logarithmic factors)
  by simple learning algorithms. We also extend our lower bounds to more general mixture-of-clusters
  models. Our definitions and results build on the work of Brown et al. (2021) and
  address several limitations of the lower bounds in their work.
