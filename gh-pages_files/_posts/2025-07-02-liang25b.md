title: Characterizing Dependence of Samples along the Langevin Dynamics and Algorithms
  via Contraction of $Φ$-Mutual Information (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The mixing time of a Markov chain determines how fast the iterates of the
  Markov chain converge to the stationary distribution; however, it does not control
  the dependencies between samples along the Markov chain. In this paper, we study
  the question of how fast the samples become approximately independent along popular
  Markov chains for continuous-space sampling: the Langevin dynamics in continuous
  time, and the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Proximal Sampler in discrete
  time. We measure the dependence between samples via $\Phi$-mutual information, which
  is a broad generalization of the standard mutual information, and which is equal
  to $0$ if and only if the the samples are independent. We show that along these
  Markov chains, the $\Phi$-mutual information between the first and the $k$-th iterate
  decreases to $0$ exponentially fast in $k$ when the target distribution is strongly
  log-concave. Our proof technique is based on showing the Strong Data Processing
  Inequalities (SDPIs) hold along the Markov chains. To prove fast mixing of the Markov
  chains, we only need to show the SDPIs hold for the stationary distribution. In
  contrast, to prove the contraction of $\Phi$-mutual information, we need to show
  the SDPIs hold along the entire trajectories of the Markov chains; we prove this
  when the iterates along the Markov chains satisfy the corresponding $\Phi$-Sobolev
  inequality, which is implied by the strong log-concavity of the target distribution. '
