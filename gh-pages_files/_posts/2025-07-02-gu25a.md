title: Tight Bounds for Noisy Computation of High-Influence Functions, Connectivity,
  and Threshold
section: Original Papers
abstract: In the noisy query model, the (binary) return value of every query (possibly
  repeated) is independently flipped with some fixed probability $p \in (0, 1/2)$.
  In this paper, we obtain tight bounds on the noisy query complexity of several fundamental
  problems. Our first contribution is to show that any Boolean function with total
  influence $\Omega(n)$ has noisy query complexity $\Theta(n\log n)$. Previous works
  often focus on specific problems, and it is of great interest to have a characterization
  of noisy query complexity for general functions. Our result is the first noisy query
  complexity lower bound of this generality, beyond what was known for random Boolean
  functions (Reischuk and Schmeltz, FOCS 1991). Our second contribution is to prove
  that Graph Connectivity has noisy query complexity $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$. In this
  problem, the goal is to determine whether an undirected graph is connected, where
  each query asks for the existence of an edge in the graph. A simple algorithm can
  solve the problem with error probability $o(1)$ using $O(n^2 \log n)$ noisy queries,
  but no non-trivial lower bounds were known prior to this work. Last but not least,
  we determine the exact number of noisy queries (up to lower order terms) needed
  to solve the $k$-Threshold problem and the Counting problem. The $k$-Threshold problem
  asks to decide whether there are at least $k$ ones among $n$ bits, given noisy query
  access to the bits. We prove that $(1\pm o(1)) \frac{n\log (\min\{k,n-k+1\}/\delta)}{(1-2p)\log
  \frac{1-p}p}$ queries are both sufficient and necessary to achieve error probability
  $\delta = o(1)$. Previously, such a result was only known when $\min\{k,n-k+1\}=o(n)$
  (Wang, Ghaddar, Zhu and Wang, ALT 2025). We also show a similar $(1\pm o(1)) \frac{n\log
  (\min\{k+1,n-k+1\}/\delta)}{(1-2p)\log \frac{1-p}p}$ bound for the Counting problem,
  where one needs to count the number of ones among $n$ bits given noisy query access
  and $k$ denotes the answer.
