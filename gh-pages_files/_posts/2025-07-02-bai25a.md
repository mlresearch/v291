title: Faster Acceleration for Steepest Descent
section: Original Papers
abstract: Recent advances (Sherman, 2017; Sidford and Tian, 2018; Cohen et al., 2021)
  have overcome the fundamental barrier of dimension dependence in the iteration complexity
  of solving $\ell_\infty$ regression with first-order methods. Yet it remains unclear
  to what extent such acceleration can be achieved for general $\ell_p$ smooth functions.
  In this paper, we propose a new accelerated first-order method for convex optimization
  under non-Euclidean smoothness assumptions. In contrast to standard acceleration
  techniques, our approach uses primal-dual iterate sequences taken with respect to
  \textit{differing} norms, which are then coupled using an \textit{implicitly} determined
  interpolation parameter. For $\ell_p$ norm smooth problems in $d$ dimensions, our
  method provides an iteration complexity improvement of up to $O(d^{1-\frac{2}{p}})$
  in terms of calls to a first-order oracle, thereby allowing us to circumvent long-standing
  barriers in accelerated non-Euclidean steepest descent.
