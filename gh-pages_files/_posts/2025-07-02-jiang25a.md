title: Regularized Dikin Walks for Sampling Truncated Logconcave Measures, Mixed Isoperimetry
  and Beyond Worst-Case Analysis
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study sampling from logconcave distributions truncated on polytopes,
  motivated by Bayesian models with indicator variables. Built on interior point methods
  and the Dikin walk, we analyze the mixing time of regularized Dikin walks. Our contributions
  include: (1) proving that the soft-threshold Dikin walk mixes in $\widetilde{O}(mn+\kappa
  n)$ iterations for logconcave distributions with condition number $\kappa$, dimension
  $n$ and $m$ linear constraints, without requiring bounded polytopes. Moreover, we
  introduce the regularized Dikin walk using Lewis weights and show it mixes in  $\widetilde{O}(n^{2.5}+\kappa
  n)$; (2) extending the above mixing time guarantees to weakly log-concave truncated
  distributions with finite covariance matrices; and (3) going beyond worst-case mixing
  time analysis, we show that soft-threshold Dikin walk mixes significantly faster
  when $O(1)$ number of constraints intersect the high-probability mass of the distribution,
  improving the $\widetilde{O}(mn+\kappa n)$ upper bound to $\widetilde{O}(m + \kappa
  n)$. Additionally, we provide practical implementation to generate a warm initialization.'
