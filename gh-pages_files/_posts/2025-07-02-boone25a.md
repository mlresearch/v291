title: Logarithmic regret of exploration in average reward Markov decision processes
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'In average reward Markov decision processes, state-of-the-art algorithms
  for regret minimization follow a well-established framework: They are model-based,
  optimistic and episodic. First, they maintain a confidence region from which optimistic
  policies are computed using a well-known subroutine called Extended Value Iteration
  (EVI). Second, these policies are used over time windows called episodes, each ended
  by the Doubling Trick  (DT) rule or a variant thereof.  In this work, without modifying
  EVI, we show that there is a significant advantage in replacing the doubling trick
  by another simple rule, that we call the Vanishing Multiplicative rule (VM). When
  managing episodes with VM, the algorithmâ€™s regret is, both in theory and in practice,
  as good if not better than with DT while the one-shot behavior is greatly improved.  More
  specifically, the management of bad episodes (when sub-optimal policies are being
  used) is much better under VM than DT by making the regret of exploration logarithmic
  rather than linear. These results are made possible by a new in-depth understanding
  of the contrasting behaviors of confidence regions during good and bad episodes.'
