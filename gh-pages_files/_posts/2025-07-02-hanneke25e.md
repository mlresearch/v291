title: 'Open Problem: Data Selection for Regression Tasks'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'This note proposes a set of open problems concerning data selection in
  regression tasks. The central question is: given a natural learning rule $\mathcal{A}$
  and a selection budget $n$, how well can $\mathcal{A}$ perform when trained on $n$
  examples selected from a larger dataset? We present concrete instances of this question
  in basic regression settings, including mean estimation and linear regression.'
