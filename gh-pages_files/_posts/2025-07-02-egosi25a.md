title: Logarithmic Width Suffices for Robust Memorization
section: Original Papers
abstract: "    The memorization capacity of neural networks with a given architecture
  has been thoroughly studied in many works. Specifically, it is well-known that memorizing
  $N$ samples can be done using a network of constant width, independent of $N$. However,
  the required constructions are often quite delicate. In this paper, we consider
  the natural question of how well feedforward ReLU neural networks can memorize \\emph{robustly},
  namely while being able to withstand adversarial perturbations of a given radius.
  \ We establish both upper and lower bounds on the possible radius for general $l_p$
  norms, implying (among other things) that width \\emph{logarithmic} in the number
  of input samples is necessary and sufficient to achieve robust memorization (with
  robustness radius independent of $N$)."
