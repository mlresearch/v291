title: Can a calibration metric be both testable and actionable?
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Forecast probabilities often serve as critical inputs for binary decision
  making. In such settings, calibration—ensuring forecasted probabilities match empirical
  frequencies—is essential. Although the common notion of Expected Calibration Error
  (ECE) provides actionable insights for decision making, it is not testable: it cannot
  be empirically estimated in many practical cases. Conversely, the recently proposed
  Distance from Calibration (dCE) is testable, but it is not actionable since it lacks
  decision-theoretic guarantees needed for high-stakes applications. To resolve this
  question, we consider Cutoff Calibration Error, a calibration measure that bridges
  this gap by assessing calibration over intervals of forecasted probabilities. We
  show that Cutoff Calibration Error is both testable and actionable, and we examine
  its implications for popular post-hoc calibration methods, such as isotonic regression
  and Platt scaling.'
