title: Improved sample upper and lower bounds for trace estimation of quantum state
  powers
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'As often emerges in various basic quantum properties such as entropy, the
  trace of quantum state powers $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ has attracted a lot of
  attention. The recent work of Liu and Wang (SODA 2025) showed that $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$
  can be estimated to within additive error $\varepsilon$ with a dimension-independent
  sample complexity of $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon^{3+\frac{2}{q-1}})$ for any constant
  $q > 1$, where only an $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bound was given. In this paper,
  we significantly improve the sample complexity of estimating $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$
  in both the upper and lower bounds. In particular: - For $q > 2$, we settle the
  sample complexity with matching upper and lower bounds $\widetilde \Theta(1/\varepsilon^2)$.
  - For $1 < q < 2$, we provide an upper bound $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{q-1}})$,
  with a lower bound $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{\max\{\frac{1}{q-1}, 2\}})$ for dimension-independent
  estimators, implying there is only room for a quadratic improvement. Our upper bounds
  are obtained by (non-plug-in) quantum estimators based on weak Schur sampling, in
  sharp contrast to the prior approach based on quantum singular value transformation
  and samplizer.'
