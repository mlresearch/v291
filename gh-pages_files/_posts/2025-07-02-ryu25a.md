title: 'Improved Offline Contextual Bandits with Second-Order Bounds: Betting and
  Freezing'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider off-policy selection and learning in contextual bandits, where
  the learner aims to select or train a reward-maximizing policy using data collected
  by a fixed behavior policy. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a novel
  off-policy selection method that leverages a new betting-based confidence bound
  applied to an inverse propensity weight sequence. Our theoretical analysis reveals
  that this method achieves a significantly improved, variance-adaptive guarantee
  over prior work. Second, we propose a novel and generic condition on the optimization
  objective for off-policy learning that strikes a different balance between bias
  and variance. One special case, which we call freezing, tends to induce low variance,
  which is preferred in small-data regimes. Our analysis shows that it matches the
  best existing guarantees. In our empirical study, our selection method outperforms
  existing methods, and freezing exhibits improved performance in small-sample regimes.
