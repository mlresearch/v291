title: 'The Oracle Complexity of Simplex-based Matrix Games: Linear Separability and
  Nash Equilibria'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form $\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$,
  where $A$ is some matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem encapsulates
  canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing Nash equilibria
  in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent complexity (as formalized
  in the standard framework of oracle complexity (Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983)) is
  not well-understood. In this work, we first identify different oracle models which
  are implicitly used by prior algorithms, amounting to multiplying the matrix $A$
  by a vector from either one or both sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds
  for algorithms under both access models, which in particular imply a separation
  between them. Specifically, we start by showing that algorithms for linear separability
  based on one-sided multiplications must require $\Omega(\gamma_A^{-2})$ iterations,
  where $\gamma_A$ is the margin, as matched by the Perceptron algorithm. We then
  prove that accelerated algorithms for this task, which utilize multiplications from
  both sides, must require $\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{A}^{-2/3})$ iterations, establishing
  the first oracle complexity barrier for such algorithms. Finally, by adapting our
  lower bound to $\ell_1$ geometry, we prove that computing an $\epsilon$-approximate
  Nash equilibrium requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/5})$ iterations, which is
  an exponential improvement over the previously best-known lower bound due to Hadiji
  et al. (2024).
