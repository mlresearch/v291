title: Improved Algorithms for Effective Resistance Computation on Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: Effective Resistance (ER) is a fundamental tool in various graph learning
  tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently approximating ER on
  a graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
  First, we focus on local online-computation algorithms for ER approximation, aiming
  to improve the dependency on the approximation error parameter $\epsilon$. Specifically,
  for a given vertex pair $(s,t)$, we propose a local algorithm with a time complexity
  of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon)$ to compute an $\epsilon$-approximation of the
  $s,t$-ER value for expander graphs, where $d=\min \{d_s,d_t\}$. This improves upon
  the previous state-of-the-art, including an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ time algorithm
  based on random walk sampling by Andoni et al. (ITCS’19) and Peng et al. (KDD’21).
  Our method achieves this improvement by combining deterministic search with random
  walk sampling to reduce variance. Second, we establish a lower bound for ER approximation
  on expander graphs. We prove that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$, there exist an expander
  graph and a vertex pair $(s,t)$ such that any local algorithm requires at least
  $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ time to compute the $\epsilon$-approximation of the $s,t$-ER
  value. Finally, we extend our techniques to index-based algorithms for ER computation.
  We propose an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(\min \{m+n/\epsilon^{1.5},\sqrt{nm}/\epsilon\})$
  processing time, $\tilde{O}(n/\epsilon)$ space complexity and $O(1)$ query complexity,
  which returns an $\epsilon$-approximation of the $s,t$-ER value for any $s,t\in
  \mathcal{V}$ for expander graphs. Our approach improves upon the state-of-the-art
  $\tilde{O}(m/\epsilon)$ processing time by Dwaraknath et al. (NeurIPS’24) and the
  $\tilde{O}(m+n/\epsilon^2)$ processing time by Li and Sachdeva (SODA’23).
