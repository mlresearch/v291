title: Optimal Graph Reconstruction by Counting Connected Components in Induced Subgraphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various
  query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number of
  connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph parameters.
  Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node $m$-edge graph with
  oracle queries of the following form: provided with a subset of vertices, the oracle
  returns the number of connected components in the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m
  \log n}{\log m})$ queries in expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively
  reconstruct the graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries
  are required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$
  query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.'
