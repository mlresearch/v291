  Weak Convergence Extended Abstract'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the problem of detecting and recovering a planted spanning tree
  $M_n^*$ hidden within a complete, randomly weighted graph $G_n$.  Specifically,
  each edge $e$ has a non-negative weight drawn independently from $P_n$ if $e \in
  M_n^*$ and from $Q_n$ otherwise, where $P_n \equiv P$ is fixed and $Q_n$ scales
  with $n$ such that its density at the origin satisfies $\lim_{n\to\infty} n Q’_n(0)=1.$
  We consider two representative cases: when $M_n^*$ is either a uniform spanning
  tree or a uniform Hamiltonian path. We analyze the recovery performance of the minimum
  spanning tree (MST) algorithm and derive a fixed-point equation that characterizes
  the asymptotic fraction of edges in $M_n^*$ successfully recovered by the MST as  $n
  \to \infty.$ Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic mean  weight of the MST, extending
  Frieze’s $\zeta(3)$ result to the planted model. {Leveraging this result, we design
  an efficient test based on the MST weight and show that it can distinguish the planted
  model from the unplanted model with vanishing testing error as  $n \to \infty.$}
  Our analysis relies on an asymptotic characterization of the local structure of
  the planted model, employing the framework of local weak convergence.'
