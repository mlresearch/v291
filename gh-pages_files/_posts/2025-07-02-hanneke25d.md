title: Private List Learnability vs. Online List Learnability
section: Original Papers
abstract: This work explores the connection between differential privacy (DP) and
  online learning in the context of PAC list learning. In this setting, a $k$-list
  learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance $x$ and incurs
  a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A basic result in the
  multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels states that private learnability
  is equivalent to online learnability [Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019);
  Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly,
  we show that this equivalence does not hold in the context of list learning. Specifically,
  we prove that, unlike in the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimension-a
  variant of the classical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list
  learnability-is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability. However,
  similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary condition.
  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example showing
  that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over $\mathbb{N}$ is online
  $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This leads us to introduce a
  new combinatorial dimension, the \emph{$k$-monotone dimension}, which serves as
  a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike the multiclass setting, where
  the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are finite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone
  and $k$-monotone dimensions do not exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite
  $k$-monotone dimension is another necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability,
  alongside finite $k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions
  implies private $k$-list learnability remains an open question.
