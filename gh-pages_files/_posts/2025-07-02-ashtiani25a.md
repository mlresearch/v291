title: Simplifying Adversarially Robust PAC Learning With Tolerance
section: Original Papers
abstract: Adversarially robust PAC learning has proved to be challenging, with the
  currently best known learners relying on improper methods based on intricate compression
  schemes, resulting in sample complexity exponential in the VC-dimension. A series
  of follow up work considered a slightly relaxed version of the problem called adversarially
  robust learning \emph{with tolerance} and achieved better sample complexity in terms
  of the VC-dimension. However, those algorithms were either improper and complex,
  or required additional assumptions on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$. We prove,
  for the first time, the existence of a simpler learner that achieves a sample complexity
  linear in the VC-dimension without requiring additional assumptions on $\mathcal{H}$.
  Even though our learner is improper, it is “almost proper" in the sense that it
  outputs a hypothesis that is “similar" to a hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$.  We also
  use the ideas from our algorithm to construct a semi-supervised learner in the tolerant
  setting. This simple algorithm achieves comparable bounds to the previous (non-tolerant)
  semi-supervised algorithm,  but avoids the use of intricate subroutines from previous
  works, and is “almost proper."
