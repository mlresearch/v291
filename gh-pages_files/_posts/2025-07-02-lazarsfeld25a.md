title: 'Fast and Furious Symmetric Learning in Zero-Sum Games: Gradient Descent as
  Fictitious Play'
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper investigates the sublinear regret gu rantees of two \textit{non}-no-regret
  algorithms in zero-sum games:Fictitious Play, and Online Gradient Descent with \textit{constant}
  stepsizes. In general adversarial online learning settings, both algorithms may
  exhibit instability and linear regret due to no regularization (Fictitious Play)
  or small amounts of regularization (Gradient Descent). However, their ability to
  obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum games is less understood. In
  this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees for both algorithms on a class
  of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the classic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors
  to a weighted, $n$-dimensional regime. Under \textit{symmetric initializations}
  of the players’ strategies, we prove that Fictitious Play with \textit{any tiebreaking
  rule} has $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, establishing a new class of games for which  Karlin’s
  Fictitious Play conjecture holds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the
  geometry of the iterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space
  of payoff vectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for \textit{almost all} symmetric
  initializations, obtains a similar $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize
  is a \textit{sufficiently large} constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes
  the first “fast and furious” behavior  (i.e., sublinear regret \textit{without}
  time-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than $2\times2$.
