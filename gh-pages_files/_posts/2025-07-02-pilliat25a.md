title: 'Recovering Labels from Crowdsourced Data: an Optimal and Polynomial-Time Method'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Crowdsourcing involves aggregating meaningful information from partial
  and noisy data provided by a pool of $n$ workers across $d$ tasks. Traditional models,
  such as the Dawid-Skene model, assume that workersâ€™ abilities are independent of
  tasks, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where worker ability
  often varies significantly across tasks. Recent advances have proposed permutation-based
  models, which relax these assumptions by imposing only isotonicity constraints on
  worker abilities. In this work, we study a permutation-based model where each worker
  $i$ has an ability $M_{ik}$ to recover a binary label $x_k^*\in\{-1,1\}$ for task
  $k$. The ability matrix $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to a permutation of its
  rows, and only a fraction $\lambda$ of the worker-task pairs is observed. We focus
  on three primary objectives: recovering the true labels, ranking the workers, and
  estimating the ability matrix $M$. We introduce a polynomial-time and minimax optimal
  procedure to recover the labels, contradicting a conjecture in the literature regarding
  the existence of a statistical-computational gap for this problem. Additionally,
  building on the literature on ranking, we further introduce a polynomial-time procedure
  to rank the workers and to estimate their abilities. Notably, we show that ranking
  the workers or estimating their abilities is no harder when the true labels are
  unknown than when they are known, within the main regimes of interest in the isotonic
  model.'
