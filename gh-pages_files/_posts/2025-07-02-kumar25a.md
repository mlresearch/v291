title: Spike-and-Slab Posterior Sampling in High Dimensions
section: Original Papers
abstract: Posterior sampling with the spike-and-slab prior (Mitchell and Beauchamp,
  1988), a popular multi-modal distribution used to model uncertainty in variable
  selection, is considered the theoretical gold standard method for Bayesian sparse
  linear regression (Carvalho et al., 2009; Rockova, 2018). However, designing provable
  algorithms for performing this sampling task is notoriously challenging. Existing
  posterior samplers for Bayesian sparse variable selection tasks either require strong
  assumptions about the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (Yang et al., 2016), only work
  when the measurement count grows at least linearly in the dimension (Montanari and
  Wu, 2024), or rely on heuristic approximations to the posterior. We give the first
  provable algorithms for spike-and-slab posterior sampling that apply for any SNR,
  and use a measurement count sublinear in the problem dimension. Concretely, assume
  we are given a measurement matrix $X \in \R^{n \times d}$ and noisy observations
  $y = X\theta^\star + \xi$ of a signal $\theta^\star$ drawn from a spike-and-slab
  prior $\pi$ with a Gaussian diffuse density and expected sparsity $k$, where $\xi
  \sim \mathcal{N}(0_d, \sigma^2 I_n)$. We give a polynomial-time high-accuracy sampler
  for the posterior $\pi(\cdot \mid X, y)$, for any SNR $\sigma^{-1} > 0$, as long
  as $n \geq k^3 \cdot \text{polylog}(d)$ and $X$ is drawn from a matrix ensemble
  satisfying the restricted isometry property. We further give a sampler that runs
  in near-linear time $\approx nd$ in the same setting, as long as $n \geq k^5 \cdot
  \text{polylog}(d)$. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we extend our
  result to spike-and-slab posterior sampling with Laplace diffuse densities, achieving
  similar guarantees when $\sigma = O(\frac{1}{k})$ is bounded.
