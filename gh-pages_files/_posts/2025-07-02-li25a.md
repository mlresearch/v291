title: Robust random graph matching in Gaussian models via vector approximate message
  passing
section: Original Papers
abstract: " In this paper, we focus on the matching recovery problem between a pair
  of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices with a latent vertex correspondence. Although
  Polynomial-time algorithms for graph matching have been studied in the line of work
  (Barak et al. (2019); Ding et al. (2021); Fan et al. (2023a,b); Ganassali and Massouli√©
  (2020); Ganassali et al. (2024a); Mao et al. (2021, 2023a); Ganassali et al. (2024b);
  Mao et al. (2023b); Ding and Li (2025+, 2023)), many of the efficient algorithms
  used to achieve matching recovery are believed to be fragile in the sense that adversarially
  modifying a small fraction of edges could fool the algorithm into outputting a result
  which deviates strongly from the true underlying matching. Thus, we are particularly
  interested in a robust version of this problem such that our observation is a perturbed
  input $(A+E,B+F)$ where $(A,B)$ is a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices
  and $E,F$ are adversarially chosen matrices supported on an unknown $\\epsilon n
  * \\epsilon n$ principle minor of $A,B$, respectively. We propose a vector approximate
  message passing (vector AMP) algorithm that succeeds in polynomial time as long
  as the correlation $\\rho$ between $(A,B)$ is a non-vanishing constant and $\\epsilon
  = o\\big( \\frac{1}{(\\log n)^{20}} \\big)$.  The main methodological inputs for
  our result are the iterative random graph matching algorithm proposed in Ding and
  Li (2025+, 2023) and the spectral cleaning procedure proposed in Ivkov and Schramm
  (2025). To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient random
  graph matching type algorithm that is robust under any adversarial perturbations
  of $n^{1-o(1)}$ size."
