title: Computational Equivalence of Spiked Covariance and Spiked Wigner Models via
  Gram-Schmidt Perturbation
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this work, we show the first average-case reduction transforming the
  sparse Spiked Covariance Model into the sparse Spiked Wigner Model and as a consequence
  obtain the first computational equivalence result between two well-studied high-dimensional
  statistics models. Our approach leverages a new perturbation equivariance property
  for Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, enabling removal of dependence in the noise
  while preserving the signal.
