title: Span-Agnostic Optimal Sample Complexity and Oracle Inequalities for Average-Reward
  RL
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the sample complexity of finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy
  in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The
  minimax optimal span-based complexity of $\widetilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$, where
  $H$ is the span of the optimal bias function, has only been achievable with prior
  knowledge of the value of $H$. Prior-knowledge-free algorithms have been the objective
  of intensive research, but several natural approaches provably fail to achieve this
  goal. We resolve this problem, developing the first algorithms matching the optimal
  span-based complexity without $H$ knowledge, both when the dataset size is fixed
  and when the suboptimality level $\varepsilon$ is fixed. Our main technique combines
  the discounted reduction approach with a method for automatically tuning the effective
  horizon based on empirical confidence intervals or lower bounds on performance,
  which we term \textit{horizon calibration}. We also develop an \textit{empirical
  span penalization} approach, inspired by sample variance penalization, which satisfies
  an \textit{oracle inequality} performance guarantee. In particular this algorithm
  can outperform the minimax complexity in benign settings such as when there exist
  near-optimal policies with span much smaller than $H$.
