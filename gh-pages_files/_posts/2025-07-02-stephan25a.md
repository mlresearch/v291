title: Community detection with the Bethe-Hessian
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov{รก}
  (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms
  to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking
  operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to
  also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block
  model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral
  method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree
  regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq
  2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently
  estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming
  a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov{รก} (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For
  sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii)
  As  $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative
  outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method
  based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.'
