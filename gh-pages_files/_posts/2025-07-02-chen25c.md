title: Predicting quantum channels over general product distributions
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown
  quantum channels. Given query access to an $n$-qubit channel $\mathcal{E}$ and an
  observable $\mathcal{O}$, we aim to learn the mapping \begin{equation*} \rho \mapsto
  \Tr(\mathcal{O} \mathcal{E}[\rho]) \end{equation*} to within a small error for most
  $\rho$ sampled from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$. Previously, Huang et al. proved
  a surprising result that even if $\mathcal{E}$ is arbitrary, this task can be solved
  in time roughly $n^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target prediction
  error.  However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions $\mathcal{D}$
  invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important
  cases such as general product distributions over product states $\rho$.  In this
  work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially
  any product distribution $\mathcal{D}$, provided it is not “classical” in which
  case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a “biased Pauli
  analysis,” analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach
  requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including
  the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we
  develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information. '
