title: Low-dimensional Functions are Efficiently Learnable under Randomly Biased Distributions
section: Original Papers
abstract: The problem of learning single-index and multi-index models has gained significant
  interest as a fundamental task in high-dimensional statistics. Many recent works
  have analyzed gradient-based methods, particularly in the setting of isotropic data
  distributions, often in the context of neural network training. Such studies have
  uncovered precise characterizations of algorithmic sample complexity in terms of
  certain analytic properties of the target function, such as the leap, information,
  and generative exponents. These properties establish a quantitative separation between
  low- and high-complexity learning tasks. In this work, we show that high-complexity
  cases are rare. Specifically, we prove that introducing a small random perturbation
  to the data distribution-via a random shift in the first moment-renders any Gaussian
  single-index model as easy to learn as a linear function. We further extend this
  result to a class of multi-index models, namely sparse Boolean functions, also known
  as Juntas.
