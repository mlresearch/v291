title: 'Spectral Estimators for Multi-Index Models: Precise Asymptotics and Optimal
  Weak Recovery'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Multi-index models provide a popular framework to investigate the learnability
  of functions with low-dimensional structure and, also due to their connections with
  neural networks, they have been object of recent intensive study. In this paper,
  we focus on recovering the subspace spanned by the signals via spectral estimators
  – a family of methods routinely used in practice, often as a warm-start for iterative
  algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a precise asymptotic characterization
  of the performance of spectral methods, when sample size and input dimension grow
  proportionally and the dimension $p$ of the space to recover is fixed. Specifically,
  we locate the top-$p$ eigenvalues of the spectral matrix and establish the overlaps
  between the corresponding eigenvectors (which give the spectral estimators) and
  a basis of the signal subspace. Our analysis unveils a phase transition phenomenon
  in which, as the sample complexity grows, eigenvalues escape from the bulk of the
  spectrum and, when that happens, eigenvectors recover directions of the desired
  subspace. The precise characterization we put forward enables the optimization of
  the data preprocessing, thus allowing to identify the spectral estimator that requires
  the minimal sample size for weak recovery.
