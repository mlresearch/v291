title: 'From Fairness to Infinity: Outcome-Indistinguishable (Omni)Prediction in Evolving
  Graphs'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Professional networks provide invaluable entree to opportunity through referrals
  and introductions. A rich literature shows they also serve to entrench and even
  exacerbate a status quo of privilege and disadvantage. Hiring platforms, equipped
  with the ability to nudge link formation, provide a tantalizing opening for beneficial
  structural change. We anticipate that key to this prospect will be the ability to
  estimate the likelihood of edge formation in an evolving graph.  Outcome-indistinguishable
  prediction algorithms ensure that the modeled world is indistinguishable from the
  real world by a family of statistical tests. Omnipredictors ensure that predictions
  can be post-processed to yield loss minimization competitive with respect to a benchmark
  class of predictors for many losses simultaneously, with appropriate post-processing.
  We begin by observing that, by combining a slightly modified form of the online
  K29* algorithm of Vovk (2007) with basic facts from the theory of reproducing kernel
  Hilbert spaces, one can derive simple and efficient online algorithms satisfying
  outcome indistinguishability and omniprediction, with guarantees that improve upon,
  or are complementary to, those currently known. This is of independent interest;
  for example, we obtain efficient outcome indistinguishability for some interesting
  infinite collections of tests, as well as for any bounded function — including those
  computable by deep (graph) neural networks. We apply these techniques to evolving
  graphs by designing efficient kernel functions that capture socially meaningful
  features of nodes and their neighborhoods. We obtain online outcome-indistinguishable
  omnipredictors for rich — possibly infinite — sets of distinguishers yielding, inter
  alia, multicalibrated predictions of edge formation with respect to pairs of demographic
  groups, and the ability to simultaneously optimize loss as measured by a variety
  of social welfare functions.
