title: Solving Convex-Concave Problems with $\mathcalO(ε^-4/7)$ Second-Order Oracle
  Complexity
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Previous algorithms can solve convex-concave minimax problems $\min_{x
  \in \mathcal{X}} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} f(x,y)$ with $\gO(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ second-order
  oracle calls using Newton-type methods.    This result has been speculated to be
  optimal because the upper bound is achieved by a natural generalization of the optimal
  first-order method. In this work, we show an improved upper bound of $\tilde{\gO}(\epsilon^{-4/7})$  by
  generalizing the optimal second-order method for convex optimization to solve the
  convex-concave minimax problem.  We further apply a similar technique to lazy Hessian
  algorithms and show that our proposed algorithm can also be seen as a second-order
  “Catalyst” framework (Lin et al., JMLR 2018) that could accelerate any globally
  convergent algorithms for solving minimax problems.  '
