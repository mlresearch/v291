title: Structure-agnostic Optimality of Doubly Robust Learning for Treatment Effect
  Estimation (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Average treatment effect estimation is the most central problem in causal
  inference with application to numerous disciplines. While many estimation strategies
  have been proposed in the literature, the statistical optimality of these methods
  has still remained an open area of investigation, especially in regimes where these
  methods do not achieve parametric rates. In this paper, we adopt the recently introduced
  structure-agnostic framework of statistical lower bounds, which poses no structural
  properties on the nuisance functions other than access to black-box estimators that
  achieve some statistical estimation rate. This framework is particularly appealing
  when one is only willing to consider estimation strategies that use non-parametric
  regression and classification oracles as black-box sub-processes. Within this framework,
  we prove the statistical optimality of the celebrated and widely used doubly robust
  estimators for both the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment
  Effect on the Treated (ATT), as well as weighted variants of the former, which arise  in
  policy evaluation.
