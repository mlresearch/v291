title: Experimental Design for Semiparametric Bandits
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study finite-armed semiparametric bandits, where each armâ€™s reward combines
  a linear component with an unknown, potentially adversarial shift. This model strictly
  generalizes classical linear bandits and reflects complexities common in practice.
  We propose the first experimental-design approach that simultaneously offers a sharp
  regret bound, a PAC bound, and a best-arm identification guarantee. Our method attains
  the minimax regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{dT})$, matching the known lower bound
  for finite-armed linear bandits, and further achieves logarithmic regret under a
  positive suboptimality gap condition. These guarantees follow from our refined non-asymptotic
  analysis of orthogonalized regression that attains the optimal $\sqrt{d}$ rate,
  paving the way for robust and efficient learning across a broad class of semiparametric
  bandit problems.
