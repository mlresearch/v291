title: Better Private Distribution Testing by Leveraging Unverified Auxiliary Data
section: Original Papers
abstract: We extend the framework of augmented distribution testing (Aliakbarpour,
  Indyk, Rubinfeld, and Silwal, NeurIPS 2024) to the differentially private setting.
  This captures scenarios where a data analyst must perform hypothesis testing tasks
  on sensitive data, but is able to leverage prior knowledge (public, but possibly
  erroneous or untrusted) about the data distribution. We design private algorithms
  in this augmented setting for three flagship distribution testing tasks, \emph{uniformity},
  \emph{identity}, and \emph{closeness} testing, whose sample complexity smoothly
  scales with the claimed quality of the auxiliary information. We complement our
  algorithms with information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that their sample complexity
  is optimal (up to logarithmic factors).
