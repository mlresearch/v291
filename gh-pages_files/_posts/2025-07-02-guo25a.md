title: Agnostic Learning of Arbitrary ReLU Activation under Gaussian Marginals
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning an arbitrarily-biased ReLU activation
  (or neuron) over Gaussian marginals with the squared loss objective. Despite the
  ReLU neuron being the basic building block of modern neural networks, we still do
  not understand the basic algorithmic question of whether an arbitrary ReLU neuron
  is learnable in the non-realizable setting. In particular, all existing polynomial
  time algorithms only provide approximation guarantees for the better-behaved unbiased
  setting or restricted bias setting.  Our main result is a polynomial time statistical
  query (SQ) algorithm that gives the first constant factor approximation for arbitrary
  bias. It outputs a ReLU activation that achieves a loss of $O(\mathrm{OPT}) + \varepsilon$
  in time $\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the loss obtained
  by the optimal ReLU activation. Our algorithm presents an interesting departure
  from existing algorithms, which are all based on gradient descent and thus fall
  within the class of correlational statistical query (CSQ) algorithms. We complement
  our algorithmic result by showing that no polynomial time CSQ algorithm can achieve
  a constant factor approximation. Together, these results shed light on the intrinsic
  limitation of gradient descent, while identifying arguably the simplest setting
  (a single neuron) where there is a separation between SQ and CSQ algorithms. '
