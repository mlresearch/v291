title: Optimal Differentially Private Sampling of Unbounded Gaussians
section: Original Papers
abstract: We provide the first $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$-sample algorithm for sampling
  from unbounded Gaussian distributions under the constraint of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential
  privacy. This is a quadratic improvement over previous results for the same problem,
  settling an open question of Ghazi, Hu, Kumar, and Manurangsi.
