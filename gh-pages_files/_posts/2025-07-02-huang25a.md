title: Polynomial low degree hardness for Broadcasting on Trees (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Broadcasting on trees is a fundamental model from statistical physics that
  plays an important role in information theory, noisy computation and phylogenetic
  reconstruction within computational biology and linguistics. While this model permits
  efficient linear-time algorithms for the inference of the root from the leaves,
  recent work suggests that non-trivial computational complexity may be required for
  inference. The inference of the root state can be performed using the celebrated
  Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which achieves Bayes-optimal performance. Although
  BP runs in linear time using real arithmetic operations, recent research indicates
  that it requires non-trivial computational complexity using more refined complexity
  measures.  Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon demonstrated such complexity by constructing
  a Markov chain for which estimating the root better than random guessing (for typical
  inputs) is $NC^1$-complete. Kohler and Mossel constructed chains where, for trees
  with $N$ leaves, achieving better-than-random root recovery requires polynomials
  of degree $N^{\Omega(1)}$. The papers above raised the question of whether such
  complexity bounds hold generally below the celebrated Kesten-Stigum bound. In a
  recent work, Huang and Mossel established a general degree lower bound of $\Omega(\log
  N)$ below the Kesten-Stigum bound. Specifically, they proved that any function expressed
  as a linear combination of functions of at most $O(log N)$ leaves has vanishing
  correlation with the root. In this work, we get an exponential improvement of this
  lower bound by establishing an $N^{\Omega(1)}$ degree lower bound, for any broadcast
  process in the whole regime below the Kesten-Stigum bound.
