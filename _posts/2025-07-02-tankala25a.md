title: 'Beyond propagation of chaos: A stochastic algorithm for mean field optimization'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals
  over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting
  particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing
  (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical
  distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e.,
  propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can
  be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random
  variables.  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation,
  originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be
  viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can
  be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithmâ€™s
  output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for
  the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to
  explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.
