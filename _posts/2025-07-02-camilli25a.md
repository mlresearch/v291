title: Information-theoretic reduction of deep neural networks to linear models in
  the overparametrized proportional regime
section: Original Papers
abstract: We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in
  the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where
  the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge
  proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian
  deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching
  architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model.
  This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep
  neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the "deep Gaussian equivalence principle"
  conjectured in Cui et al. (2023). Our result highlights that in order to escape
  this "trivialisation" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear
  model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained
  from much more data have to be considered.
