title: Private Realizable-to-Agnostic Transformation with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity
section: Original Papers
abstract: The realizable-to-agnostic transformation (Beimel et al., 2015; Alon et
  al., 2020) provides a general mechanism to convert a private learner in the realizable
  setting (where the examples are labeled by some function in the concept class) to
  a private learner in the agnostic setting (where no assumptions are imposed on the
  data). Specifically, for any concept class $\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\alpha$,
  a private realizable learner for $\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private
  agnostic learner while only increasing the sample complexity by $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$,
  which is essentially tight assuming a constant privacy parameter $\varepsilon =
  \Theta(1)$. However, when $\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard
  privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011), resulting
  in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2\varepsilon)$
  that involves a $1/\varepsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an improved construction
  that eliminates the dependence on $\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal
  extra sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for
  any $\varepsilon\le 1$. Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning,
  the privacy cost is only significant for the realizable part. We also leverage our
  technique to obtain a nearly tight sample complexity bound for the private prediction
  problem, resolving an open question posed by Dwork and Feldman (2018) and Dagan
  and Feldman (2020).
