title: Universality of High-Dimensional Logistic Regression and a Novel CGMT under
  Dependence with Applications to Data Augmentation
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Over the last decade, a wave of research has characterized the exact asymptotic
  risk of many high-dimensional models in the proportional regime. Two foundational
  results have driven this progress: Gaussian universality, which shows that the asymptotic
  risk of estimators trained on non-Gaussian and Gaussian data is equivalent, and
  the convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT), which characterizes the risk under Gaussian
  settings. However, these results rely on the assumption that the data consists of
  independent random vectors-an assumption that significantly limit its applicability
  to many practical setups. In this paper, we address this limitation by generalizing
  both results to the dependent setting. More precisely, we prove that Gaussian universality
  still holds for high-dimensional logistic regression under block dependence, $m$-dependence
  and special cases of $\beta$-mixing, and establish a novel CGMT framework that accommodates
  for correlation across both the covariates and observations. Using these results,
  we establish the impact of data augmentation, a widespread practice in deep learning,
  on the asymptotic risk.'
