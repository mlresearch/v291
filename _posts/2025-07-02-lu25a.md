title: Sparsity-Based Interpolation of External, Internal and Swap Regret
section: Original Papers
abstract: Focusing on the expert problem in online learning, this paper studies the
  interpolation of several performance metrics via $\phi$-regret minimization, which
  measures the total loss of an algorithm by its regret with respect to an arbitrary
  action modification rule $\phi$. With $d$ experts and $T\gg d$ rounds in total,
  we present a single algorithm achieving the instance-adaptive $\phi$-regret bound
  $ \tilde O\left\{\min\left\{\sqrt{d-d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi+1},\sqrt{d-d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi}\right\}\cdot\sqrt{T}\right\},
  $ where $d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi$ is the maximum amount of experts modified identically
  by $\phi$, and $d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi$ is the amount of experts that $\phi$ trivially
  modifies to themselves. By recovering the optimal $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$ external regret
  bound when $d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi=d$, the standard $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ internal
  regret bound when $d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi=d-1$ and the optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT})$
  swap regret bound in the worst case, we improve upon existing algorithms in the
  intermediate regimes. In addition, the computational complexity of our algorithm
  matches that of the standard swap-regret minimization algorithm due to Blum and
  Mansour (2007). Technically, building on the well-known reduction from $\phi$-regret
  minimization to external regret minimization on stochastic matrices, our main idea
  is to further convert the latter to online linear regression using Haar-wavelet-inspired
  matrix features. Then, by associating the complexity of each $\phi$ instance with
  its sparsity under the feature representation, we apply techniques from comparator-adaptive
  online learning to exploit the sparsity in this regression subroutine.
