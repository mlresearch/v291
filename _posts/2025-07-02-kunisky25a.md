title: 'Low coordinate degree algorithms II: Categorical signals and generalized stochastic
  block models'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF)—linear combinations
  of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector—can test for the
  presence of categorical structure, including community structure and generalizations
  thereof, in high-dimensional data. This complements recent results studying the
  power of LCDF in testing for continuous structure like real-valued signals corrupted
  by additive noise. We study a general form of stochastic block model (SBM), where
  a population is assigned random labels and every $p$-tuple generates an observation
  according to an arbitrary probability measure associated to the $p$ labels of its
  members. We show that the performance of LCDF admits a unified analysis for this
  class of models. As applications, we prove tight lower bounds against LCDF for broad
  families of previously studied graph and uniform hypergraph SBMs, always matching
  suitable generalizations of the Kesten-Stigum threshold. We also prove tight lower
  bounds for group synchronization and abelian group sumset problems under the “truth-or-Haar”
  noise model, and give an improved analysis of Gaussian multi-frequency group synchronization.
  In most of these models, for some parameter settings our lower bounds give new evidence
  for conjectural statistical-to-computational gaps. Finally, interpreting some of
  our findings, we propose a new analogy between categorical and continuous signals:
  a general SBM as above behaves qualitatively like a spiked $p_*$-tensor model of
  a certain order $p_*$ depending on the parameters of the SBM.'
