title: Sample and Oracle Efficient Reinforcement Learning for MDPs with Linearly-Realizable
  Value Functions
section: Original Papers
abstract: Designing sample-efficient and computationally feasible reinforcement learning
  (RL) algorithms is particularly challenging in environments with large or infinite
  state and action spaces. In this paper, we advance this effort by presenting an
  efficient algorithm for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the state-action
  value function of any policy is linear in a given feature map. This challenging
  setting can model environments with infinite states and actions, strictly generalizes
  classic linear MDPs, and currently lacks a computationally efficient algorithm under
  online access to the MDP. Specifically, we introduce a new RL algorithm that efficiently
  finds a near-optimal policy in this setting, using a number of episodes and calls
  to a cost-sensitive classification (CSC) oracle that are both polynomial in the
  problem parameters. Notably, our CSC oracle can be efficiently implemented when
  the feature dimension is constant, representing a clear improvement over state-of-the-art
  methods, which require solving non-convex problems with horizon-many variables and
  can incur computational costs that are exponential in the horizon.
