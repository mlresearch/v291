title: Faster Algorithms for Agnostically Learning Disjunctions and their Implications
section: Original Papers
abstract: " We study the algorithmic task of learning Boolean disjunctions  in the
  distribution-free agnostic PAC model. The best known  agnostic learner for the class
  of disjunctions over $\\{0, 1\\}^n$  is the $L_1$-polynomial regression algorithm,
  \ achieving complexity $2^{\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})}$.  This complexity bound is known
  to be nearly best possible  within the class of Correlational Statistical Query
  (CSQ) algorithms.  In this work, we develop an agnostic learner  for this concept
  class with complexity $2^{\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$.  Our algorithm can be implemented
  in the Statistical Query (SQ) model,  providing the first separation between the
  SQ and CSQ models in  distribution-free agnostic learning."
