title: 'Open Problem: Fixed-Parameter Tractability of Zonotope Problems'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'Neural networks with ReLU activation play a key role in modern machine
  learning. Understanding the functions represented by ReLU networks is a major topic
  in current research. Recent results are achieved via connections to tropical geometry
  based on a duality between convex piecewise linear functions and polytopes. It turns
  out that several questions about properties of functions computed by ReLU neural
  networks can be answered by solving certain problems on special polytopes called
  zonotopes. For example, computing the Lipschitz constant of a ReLU network with
  one hidden layer corresponds to norm maximization over a zonotope.  Moreover, deciding
  whether the ReLU network attains a positive output is equivalent to zonotope non-containment.
  These problems are known to be NP-hard in general but polynomial-time solvable if
  the input dimension is constant. However, it is open whether they are \emph{fixed-parameter
  tractable} (FPT) with respect to the input dimension $d$, that is, solvable in $f(d)\cdot
  n^{O(1)}$ time for some function $f$ solely depending on $d$. Notably, these zonotope
  problems also arise in other areas such as robotics and control, reachability analysis,
  pattern recognition, signal processing or political analysis. Thus, settling their
  parameterized complexity status is of broad interest. '
