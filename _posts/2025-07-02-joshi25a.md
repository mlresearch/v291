title: A Theory of Learning with Autoregressive Chain of Thought
section: Original Papers
abstract: For a given base class of sequence-to-next-token generators, we consider
  learning prompt-to-answer mappings obtained by iterating a fixed, time-invariant
  generator for multiple steps, thus generating a chain-of-thought, and then taking
  the final token as the answer. We formalize the learning problems both when the
  chain-of-thought is observed and when training only on prompt-answer pairs, with
  the chain-of-thought latent. We analyze the sample and computational complexity
  both in terms of general properties of the base class (e.g. its VC dimension) and
  for specific base classes such as linear thresholds. We present a simple base class
  that allows for universal representability and computationally tractable chain-of-thought
  learning. Central to our development is that time invariance allows for sample complexity
  that is independent of the length of the chain-of-thought. Attention arises naturally
  in our construction.
