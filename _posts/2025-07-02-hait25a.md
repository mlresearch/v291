title: Alternating Regret for Online Convex Optimization
section: Original Papers
abstract: Motivated by alternating learning dynamics in two-player games, a recent
  work by Cevher et al. (2024) shows that $o(\sqrt{T})$ alternating regret is possible
  for any $T$-round adversarial Online Linear Optimization (OLO) problem, and left
  as an open question whether the same is true for general Online Convex Optimization
  (OCO). We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the continuous
  Hedge algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ alternating
  regret for any adversarial $d$-dimensional OCO problems. We show that this implies
  an alternating learning dynamic that finds a Nash equilibrium for any convex-concave
  zero-sum games or a coarse correlated equilibrium for any convex two-player general-sum
  games at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}/T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. To further
  improve the time complexity and/or the dimension dependence, we propose another
  simple algorithm, Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with a regularizer whose convex
  conjugate is 3rd-order smooth, for OCO with smooth and self-concordant loss functions
  (such as linear or quadratic losses). We instantiate our algorithm with different
  regularizers and show that, for example, when the decision set is the $\ell_2$ ball,
  our algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{5}})$ alternating regret
  with no dimension dependence (and a better $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$
  bound for quadratic losses). We complement our results by showing some algorithm-specific
  alternating regret lower bounds, including a somewhat surprising $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$
  lower bound for a Regret Matching variant that is widely used in alternating learning
  dynamics.
