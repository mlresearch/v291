title: Truthfulness of Decision-Theoretic Calibration Measures
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Calibration measures quantify how much a forecaster’s predictions violate
  calibration, which requires that forecasts are unbiased conditioning on the forecasted
  probabilities. Two important desiderata for a calibration measure are its decision-theoretic
  implications (i.e., downstream decision-makers that best respond to the forecasts
  are always no-regret) and its truthfulness (i.e., a forecaster approximately minimizes
  error by always reporting the true probabilities). Existing measures satisfy at
  most one of the properties, but not both. We introduce a new calibration measure
  termed subsampled step calibration, $\mathrm{StepCE}^{\mathrm{sub}}$, that is both
  decision-theoretic and truthful. In particular, on any product distribution, $\mathrm{StepCE}^{\mathrm{sub}}$
  is truthful up to an $O(1)$ factor whereas prior decision-theoretic calibration
  measures suffer from an $e^{-\Omega(T)}$–$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ truthfulness gap. Moreover,
  in any smoothed setting where the conditional probability of each event is perturbed
  by a noise of magnitude $c>0$, $\mathrm{StepCE}^{\mathrm{sub}}$ is truthful up to
  an $O(\sqrt{\log(1/c)})$ factor, while prior decision-theoretic measures have an
  $e^{-\Omega(T)}$–$\Omega(T^{1/3})$ truthfulness gap. We also prove a general impossibility
  result for truthful decision-theoretic forecasting: any complete and decision-theoretic
  calibration measure must be discontinuous and non-truthful in the non-smoothed setting.'
