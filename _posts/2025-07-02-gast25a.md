title: Model predictive control is almost optimal for restless bandits
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider the discrete time infinite horizon average reward restless markovian
  bandit (RMAB) problem. We propose a model predictive control based non-stationary
  policy with a rolling computational horizon $\tau$. At each time-slot, this policy
  solves a $\tau$ horizon linear program whose first control value is kept as a control
  for the RMAB. Our solution requires minimal assumptions and quantifies the loss
  in optimality in terms of $\tau$ and the number of arms, $N$. We show that its sub-optimality
  gap is $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in general, and $\exp(-\Omega(N))$ under a local-stability
  condition. Our proof is based on a framework from dynamic control known as dissipativity.
  Our solution is easy to implement and performs very well in practice when compared
  to the state of the art. Further, both our solution and our proof methodology can
  easily be generalized to more general constrained MDP settings and should thus be
  of great interest to the burgeoning RMAB community.
