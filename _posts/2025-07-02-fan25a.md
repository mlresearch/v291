title: Learning Augmented Graph $k$-Clustering
section: Original Papers
abstract: " Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning. Previous research
  has focused on learning-augmented $k$-means in Euclidean metrics, limiting its applicability
  to complex data representations. In this paper, we generalize learning-augmented
  $k$-clustering to operate on general metrics, enabling its application to graph-structured
  and non-Euclidean domains. Our framework also relaxes restrictive cluster size constraints,
  providing greater flexibility for datasets with imbalanced or unknown cluster distributions.
  Furthermore, we extend the hardness of query complexity to general metrics: under
  the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we show that any polynomial-time algorithm
  must perform approximately $\\Omega(k / \\alpha)$ queries to achieve a $(1 + \\alpha)$-approximation.
  These contributions strengthen both the theoretical foundations and practical applicability
  of learning-augmented clustering, bridging gaps between traditional methods and
  real-world challenges."
