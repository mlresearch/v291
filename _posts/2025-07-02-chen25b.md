title: 'Decision Making in Changing Environments: Robustness, Query-Based Learning,
  and Differential Privacy'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the problem of interactive decision making in which the underlying
  environment changes over time subject to given constraints. We propose a framework,
  which we call \textit{hybrid Decision Making with Structured Observations} (hybrid
  DMSO), that provides an interpolation between the stochastic and adversarial settings
  of decision making. Within this framework, we can analyze local differentially private
  decision making, query-based learning (in particular, SQ learning), and robust and
  smooth decision making under the same umbrella, deriving upper and lower bounds
  based on variants of the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC). We further establish
  strong connections between the DECâ€™s behavior, the SQ dimension, local minimax complexity,
  learnability, and joint differential privacy. '
