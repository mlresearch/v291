title: 'Optimal Robust Estimation under Local and Global Corruptions: Stronger Adversary
  and Smaller Error'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Algorithmic robust statistics has traditionally focused on the contamination
  model where a small fraction of the samples are arbitrarily corrupted. We consider
  a recent contamination model that combines two kinds of corruptions: (i) small fraction
  of arbitrary outliers, as in classical robust statistics, and (ii) local perturbations,
  where samples may undergo bounded shifts on average. While each noise model is well
  understood individually, the combined contamination model poses new algorithmic
  challenges, with only partial results known. Existing efficient algorithms are limited
  in two ways: (i) they work only for a weak notion of local perturbations, and (ii)
  they obtain suboptimal error for isotropic subgaussian distributions (among others).
  The latter limitation led Nietert et al. (2024) to hypothesize that improving the
  error might, in fact, be computationally hard. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
  information theoretically optimal error can indeed be achieved in polynomial time,
  under an even stronger local perturbation model (the sliced-Wasserstein metric as
  opposed to the Wasserstein metric). Notably, our analysis reveals that the entire
  family of stability-based robust mean estimators continues to work optimally in
  a black-box manner for the combined contamination model. This generalization is
  particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the specific form of data corruption
  is not known in advance. We also present efficient algorithms for distribution learning
  and principal component analysis in the combined contamination model.'
