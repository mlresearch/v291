title: 'Open Problem: Regret Minimization in Heavy-Tailed Bandits with Unknown Distributional
  Parameters'
abstract: The heavy-tailed bandit problem Bubeck et al.,2013 , is a variant of the
  stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where the reward distributions have finite
  absolute raw moments of maximum order $1+\epsilon$, uniformly bounded by a constant
  $u < +\infty$, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. In this setting, most of the proposed
  approaches crucially rely on the knowledge of both $\epsilon$ and $u$. Recent works
  have highlighted that adapting to such parameters when they are unknown is harder
  than adapting to the subgaussian constant or the rewards range in non-heavy-tailed
  bandits. It is known that it is not possible to adapt to either $\epsilon$ or $u$
  without either ($i$) incurring extra regret or ($ii$) enforcing additional assumptions.
  However, it remains an open question what the best attainable performance is when
  no additional assumptions are provided. Moreover, the assumptions proposed in the
  literature are not comparable, as none of them is strictly weaker than the others.
  Thus, another open question is about the nature of the assumptions needed to compensate
  for this cost.
