title: Learning general Gaussian mixtures with efficient score matching
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the problem of learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians in $d$ dimensions.  We
  make no separation assumptions on the underlying mixture components:  we only require
  that the covariance matrices have bounded condition number  and that the means and
  covariances lie in a ball of bounded radius. We give an algorithm that draws $d^{\textrm{poly}(k/\epsilon)}$
  samples from the target mixture,  runs in sample-polynomial time, and constructs
  a sampler whose output distribution is $\epsilon$-close from the unknown mixture
  in total variation.  Prior works for this problem either (i) required exponential
  runtime in the dimension $d$, (ii) placed strong assumptions on the instance (e.g.,
  spherical covariances or clusterability), or (iii) had doubly exponential dependence
  on the number of components $k$.  Our approach departs from commonly used techniques
  for this problem like the method of moments. Instead, we leverage a recently developed
  reduction, based on diffusion models, from distribution learning to a supervised
  learning task called score matching. We give an algorithm for the latter by proving
  a structural result showing that the score function of a Gaussian mixture can be
  approximated by a piecewise-polynomial function, and there is an efficient algorithm
  for finding it. To our knowledge, this is the first example of diffusion models
  achieving a state-of-the-art theoretical guarantee for an unsupervised learning
  task.'
