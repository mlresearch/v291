title: The Fundamental Limits of Recovering Planted Subgraphs (extended abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Given an arbitrary subgraph $H=H_n$ and $p=p_n\in(0,1)$, the planted subgraph
  model is defined as follows. A statistician observes the union of the "signal,"
  which is a random "planted" copy $H^*$ of $H$, together with random "noise" in the
  form of an instance of an Erd{ö}s-R{é}nyi graph $G(n,p)$. The goal then of the statistician
  is to recover the planted $H^*$ from the observed graph. Our focus in this work
  is to understand the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) in terms of recovering the
  edges of $H^*$, as a function of $p$ and $H$. A recent paper [MNSSZ23] characterizes
  the graphs for which this MMSE curve undergoes a sharp phase transition from $0$
  to $1$ as $p$ increases, a behavior known as the All-or-Nothing phenomenon, up to
  a mild density assumption on $H$. However, their techniques fail to describe the
  MMSE curves for graphs that do not display such a sharp phase transition. In this
  paper, we provide a formula for the limiting MMSE curve for any graph $H=H_n$, up
  to the same mild density assumption. This curve is expressed in terms of a variational
  formula over pairs of subgraphs of $H$, and is inspired by the celebrated subgraph
  expectation thresholds from probabilistic combinatorics [KK07]. Furthermore, we
  give a polynomial-time description of the optimizers of this variational problem.
  This allows one to efficiently compute the MMSE curve for any given dense graph
  $H$. The proof relies on a novel graph decomposition as well as a min-max duality
  theorem which may be of independent interest. Our results generalize to the setting
  of planting arbitrary monotone boolean properties, where the statistician observes
  the union of a planted minimal element $A\subseteq[N]$ of a monotone property and
  a random $\mathrm{Ber}(p)^{\otimes N}$ vector. In this setting, we provide a variational
  formula inspired by the so-called "fractional" expectation threshold [Tal10], again
  describing the MMSE curve (in this case up to a multiplicative constant).
