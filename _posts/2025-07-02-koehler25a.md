title: Efficiently learning and sampling multimodal distributions with data-based
  initialization
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a multimodal distribution with a Markov
  chain given a small number of samples from the stationary measure. Although mixing
  can be arbitrarily slow, we show that if the Markov chain has a k-th order spectral
  gap,  initialization from a set of  $\tilde O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from the
  stationary distribution will, with high probability over the samples, efficiently
  generate a sample whose conditional law is $\varepsilon$-close in TV distance to
  the stationary measure. In particular, this applies to mixtures of $k$ distributions
  satisfying a Poincar√© inequality, with faster convergence when they satisfy a log-Sobolev
  inequality. Our bounds are stable to perturbations to the Markov chain, and in particular
  work for Langevin diffusion over $\mathbb R^d$ with score estimation error, as well
  as Glauber dynamics combined with approximation error from pseudolikelihood estimation.  This
  justifies the success of data-based initialization for score matching methods despite
  slow mixing for the data distribution, and improves and generalizes the results
  of Koehler and Vuong (2023) to have linear, rather than exponential, dependence
  on $k$ and apply to arbitrary semigroups. As a consequence of our results, we show
  for the first time that a natural class of low-complexity Ising measures can be
  efficiently learned from samples.
