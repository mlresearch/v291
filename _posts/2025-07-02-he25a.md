title: On the query complexity of sampling from non-log-concave distributions (extended
  abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional distribution with
  density $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$, which does not necessarily satisfy good isoperimetric
  conditions. Specifically, we show that for any $L,M$ satisfying $LM\ge d\ge 5$,
  $\epsilon\in \left(0,\frac{1}{200}\right)$, and any algorithm with query accesses
  to the value of $f(x)$ and $\nabla f(x)$, there exists an $L$-log-smooth distribution
  with second moment at most $M$ such that the algorithm requires $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$
  queries to compute a sample whose distribution is within $\epsilon$ in total variation
  distance to the target distribution. We complement the lower bound with an algorithm
  requiring $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\mathcal O(d)}$ queries, thereby characterizing
  the tight (up to the constant in the exponent) query complexity for sampling from
  the family of non-log-concave distributions. Our results are in sharp contrast with
  the recent work of Huang et al. (COLT’24), where an algorithm with quasi-polynomial
  query complexity was proposed for sampling from a non-log-concave distribution when
  $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. Their algorithm works under the stronger condition that all
  distributions along the trajectory of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, starting from
  the target distribution, are $\mathcal O(1)$-log-smooth. We investigate this condition
  and prove that it is strictly stronger than requiring the target distribution to
  be $\mathcal O(1)$-log-smooth. Additionally, we study this condition in the context
  of mixtures of Gaussians. Finally, we place our results within the broader theme
  of “sampling versus optimization”, as studied in Ma et al. (PNAS’19). We show that
  for a wide range of parameters, sampling is strictly easier than optimization by
  a super-exponential factor in the dimension $d$.
