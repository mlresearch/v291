title: Learning DNF through Generalized Fourier Representations
section: Original Papers
abstract: The Fourier representation for the uniform distribution over the Boolean
  cube has found numerous applications in algorithms and complexity analysis. Notably,
  in learning theory, the learnability of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) under the
  uniform and product distributions has been established through such representations.  This
  paper makes three main contributions. First, it introduces a generalized Fourier
  expansion that can be used with any distribution $D$ through the representation
  of the distribution as a Bayesian network (BN). Second, it shows that the main algorithmic
  tools for learning with the Fourier representation that use membership queries to
  approximate functions by recovering their heavy Fourier coefficients, can be used
  with slight modifications with the generalized expansion.  These results hold for
  any distribution. Third, it analyzes the $L_1$ spectral norm of conjunctions under
  the new expansion, showing that it is bounded for a class of distributions which  can
  be represented by a difference-bounded tree BN,  where a parent node in the BN representation
  can change the conditional expectation of a child node by at most $\alpha<0.5$.
  Lower bounds are presented to show that such constraints are necessary.  Combining
  these contributions, the paper shows learnability of DNF with membership queries
  under difference-bounded tree BN.
