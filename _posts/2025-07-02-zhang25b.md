title: 'Linear Bandits on Ellipsoids: Minimax Optimal Algorithms'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider linear stochastic bandits where the set of actions is an ellipsoid.  We
  provide the first known minimax optimal algorithm for this problem.  We first derive
  a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the regret of any algorithm, which
  must be at least $\Omega(\min(d \sigma \sqrt{T} + d \|\theta\|_{A}, \|\theta\|_{A}
  T))$ where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ the time horizon, $\sigma^2$ the noise variance,
  $A$ a matrix defining the set of actions and $\theta$ the vector of unknown parameters.
  We then provide an algorithm whose regret matches this bound to a multiplicative
  universal constant.  The algorithm is non-classical in the sense that it is not
  optimistic, and it is not a sampling algorithm.  The main idea is to combine a novel
  sequential procedure to estimate $\|\theta\|$, followed by an explore-and-commit
  strategy informed by this estimate. The algorithm is highly computationally efficient,
  and a run requires only time $O(dT + d^2 \log(T/d) + d^3)$ and memory $O(d^2)$,
  in contrast with known optimistic algorithms, which are not implementable in polynomial
  time. We go beyond minimax optimality and show that our algorithm is locally asymptotically
  minimax optimal, a much stronger notion of optimality.  We further provide numerical
  experiments to illustrate our theoretical findings. The code to reproduce the experiments
  is available at \url{https://github.com/RaymZhang/LinearBanditsEllipsoidsMinimaxCOLT}. '
