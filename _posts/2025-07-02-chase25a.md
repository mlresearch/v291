title: Deterministic Apple Tasting
section: Original Papers
abstract: In binary ($0/1$) online classification with apple tasting feedback, the
  learner receives feedback only when predicting $1$. Besides some degenerate learning
  tasks, all previously known learning algorithms for this model are randomized. Consequently,
  prior to this work it was unknown whether deterministic apple tasting is generally
  feasible. In this work, we provide the first widely-applicable deterministic apple
  tasting learner, and show that in the realizable case, a hypothesis class is learnable
  if and only if it is deterministically learnable, confirming a conjecture of Raman,
  Subedi, Raman, Tewari-24. Quantitatively, we show that every class H is learnable
  with mistake bound $O (\sqrt{L(H) T log T})$ (where $L(H)$ is the Littlestone dimension
  of $H$), and that this is tight for some classes. This demonstrates a separation
  between a deterministic and randomized learner, where the latter can learn every
  class with mistake bound $O(\sqrt{L(H)T})$, as shown in Raman et al.-24. We further
  study the agnostic case, in which the best hypothesis makes at most $k$ many mistakes,
  and prove a trichotomy stating that every class $H$ must be either easy, hard, or
  unlearnable. Easy classes have (both randomized and deterministic) mistake bound
  $\Theta_{H}(k)$. Hard classes have randomized mistake bound $\tilde{\Theta}_{H}(k
  + \sqrt{T})$, and deterministic mistake bound $\tilde{\Theta}_{H}(\sqrt{k \cdot
  T})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. Unlearnable classes have (both randomized and
  deterministic) mistake bound $\Theta(T)$. Our upper bound is based on a deterministic
  algorithm for learning from expert advice with apple tasting feedback, a problem
  interesting in its own right. For this problem, we show that the optimal deterministic
  mistake bound is $\Theta (\sqrt{T (k + \log n)})$ for all $k$ and $T \leq n \leq
  2^T$, where $n$ is the number of experts. Our algorithm is a natural variation of
  the well-known exponential weights forecaster.
