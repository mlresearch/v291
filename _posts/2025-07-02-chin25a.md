title: Stochastic block models with many communities and the Kesten–Stigum bound -
  extended abstract
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the inference of communities in stochastic block models with a
  growing number of communities. For block models with $n$ vertices and a fixed number
  of communities $q$, it was predicted in Decelle et al. (2011) that there are computationally
  efficient algorithms for recovering the communities above the Kesten–Stigum (KS)
  bound and that efficient recovery is impossible below the KS bound. This conjecture  has
  since stimulated a lot of interest, with the achievability side proven in a line
  of research that culminated in the work of Abbe and Sandon (2018). Conversely,  recent
  work provides evidence for the hardness part using the low-degree paradigm. In this
  paper we investigate community recovery in the regime $q=q_n \to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$
  where no such predictions exist. We show that efficient inference of communities
  remains possible above the KS bound. Furthermore, we show that recovery of block
  models is low-degree hard below the KS bound when the number of communities satisfies
  $q\ll \sqrt{n}$. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that when $q \gg \sqrt{n}$, there
  is an efficient algorithm based on non-backtracking walks for recovery even below
  the KS bound. We identify a new threshold and ask if it is the threshold for efficient
  recovery in this regime. Finally, we show that detection is easy and identify (up
  to a constant) the information-theoretic threshold for community recovery as the
  number of communities $q$ diverges.  Our low-degree hardness results also naturally
  have consequences for graphon estimation, improving results of Luo and Gao (2024).
