title: Regret Bounds for Robust Online Decision Making
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We propose a framework which generalizes “decision making with structured
  observations" from Foster et al. (2023) by allowing \emph{robust} (i.e. multivalued)
  models. In this framework, each model associates each decision with a \emph{convex
  set} of probability distributions over outcomes. Nature can choose distributions
  out of this set in an arbitrary (adversarial) manner, that can be non-oblivious
  and depend on past history. The resulting framework offers much greater generality
  than classical bandits and reinforcement learning, since the realizability assumption
  becomes much weaker and more realistic. We then derive a theory of regret bounds
  for this framework, which extends the “decision-estimation coefficients" of Foster
  et al. (2023). Although our lower and upper bounds are not tight, they are sufficient
  to fully characterize power-law learnability. We demonstrate this theory in two
  special cases: robust linear bandits (previously studied in Kosoy (2024)) and tabular
  robust online reinforcement learning (previously studied in Tian et al. (2021)).
  In both cases, we derive regret bounds that improve state-of-the-art (except that
  we do not address computational efficiency).'
