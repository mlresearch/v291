title: Testing Thresholds and Spectral Properties of High-Dimensional Random Toroidal
  Graphs via Edgeworth-Style Expansions
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study high-dimensional random geometric graphs (RGGs) of edge-density
  $p$ with vertices uniformly distributed on the $d$-dimensional torus and edges inserted
  between \say{sufficiently close} vertices with respect to an $L_q$-norm. In this
  setting, we focus on distinguishing an RGG from an Erdős–Rényi graph if both models
  have the same marginal edge probability $p$. So far, most results in the literature
  considered either spherical RGGs with $L_2$-distance or toroidal RGGs under $L_\infty$-distance.
  However, for general $L_q$-distances, many questions remain open, especially if
  $p$ is allowed to depend on $n$. The main reason for this is that RGGs under $L_q$-distances
  can not easily be represented as the logical \say{AND} of their 1-dimensional counterparts,
  as is the case for $L_\infty$ geometries. To overcome this difficulty, we devise
  a novel technique for quantifying the dependence between edges based on a modified
  version of Edgeworth expansions. Our technique yields the first tight algorithmic
  upper bounds for distinguishing toroidal RGGs under general $L_q$ norms from Erdős–Rényi
  graphs for any fixed $p$ and $q$. We achieve this by showing that the signed triangle
  statistic can distinguish the two models when $d\ll n^3p^3$ for the whole regime
  of edge probabilities $\frac{c}{n}<p<1$. Additionally, our technique yields an improved
  information-theoretic lower bound for this task, showing that the two distributions
  converge in total variation whenever $d=\tilde{\Omega}(n^3p^2)$, which is just as
  strong as the currently best known lower bound for spherical RGGs in case of general
  $p$ from Liu et al. [STOC’22]. Finally, our expansions allow us to tightly characterize
  the spectral properties of toroidal RGGs both under $L_q$-distances for fixed $1
  \le q < \infty$, and $L_\infty$-distance. We find that these are quite different
  for $q<\infty$ vs. $q=\infty$. Our results partially resolve a conjecture of Bangachev
  and Bressler [COLT ’24] and prove that the distance metric, rather than the underlying
  space, is responsible for the observed differences in the behavior of high-dimensional
  spherical and toroidal RGGs.
