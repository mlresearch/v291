title: Online Convex Optimization with a Separation Oracle
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new projection-free algorithm for Online Convex
  Optimization (OCO) with a state-of-the-art regret guarantee among separation-based
  algorithms. Existing projection-free methods based on the classical Frank-Wolfe
  algorithm achieve a suboptimal regret bound of $O(T^{3/4})$, while more recent separation-based
  approaches guarantee a regret bound of $O(\kappa \sqrt{T})$, where $\kappa$ denotes
  the asphericity of the feasible set, defined as the ratio of the radii of the containing
  and contained balls. However, for ill-conditioned sets, $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily
  large, potentially leading to poor performance. Our algorithm achieves a regret
  bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{dT} + \kappa d)$, while requiring only $\widetilde{O}(1)$
  calls to a separation oracle per round. Crucially, the main term in the bound, $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d
  T})$, is independent of $\kappa$, addressing the limitations of previous methods.
  Additionally, as a by-product of our analysis, we recover the $O(\kappa \sqrt{T})$
  regret bound of existing OCO algorithms with a more straightforward analysis and
  improve the regret bound for projection-free online exp-concave optimization. Finally,
  for constrained stochastic convex optimization, we achieve a state-of-the-art convergence
  rate of $\widetilde{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{T} + \kappa d/T)$, where $\sigma$ represents
  the noise in the stochastic gradients, while requiring only $\widetilde{O}(1)$ calls
  to a separation oracle per iteration.
