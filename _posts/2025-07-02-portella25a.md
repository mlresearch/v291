title: Lower Bounds for Private Estimation of Gaussian Covariance Matrices under All
  Reasonable Parameter Regimes
section: Original Papers
abstract: " One of the most basic problems in statistics is estimating the covariance
  matrix of a Gaussian distribution. Over the past decade, researchers have studied
  the efficiency of covariance estimation in the setting of differential privacy.
  The goal is to minimize the number of samples needed to achieve the desired accuracy
  and privacy guarantees. We prove lower bounds on the number of samples needed to
  privately estimate the covariance matrix of a Gaussian distribution. Our bounds
  match existing upper bounds in the widest known setting of parameters. Our analysis
  can be seen as a fingerprinting argument, one of the main techniques used to prove
  lower bounds in differential privacy. Most fingerprinting arguments rely on results
  \ analogous to the celebrated Steinâ€™s identity from probability theory. We use a
  matrix extension of this identity known as the Stein-Haff identity."
