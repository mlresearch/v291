title: Time-Uniform Self-Normalized Concentration for Vector-Valued Processes (Extended
  Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Self-normalized processes arise naturally in many learning-related tasks.
  While self-normalized concentration has been extensively studied for scalar-valued
  processes, there are few results for multidimensional processes  outside of the
  sub-Gaussian setting. In this work, we construct a general, self-normalized inequality
  for multivariate processes that satisfy a simple yet broad “sub-$\psi$” tail condition,
  which generalizes assumptions based on cumulant generating functions. From this
  general inequality, we derive an upper law of the iterated logarithm for sub-$\psi$
  vector-valued processes, which is tight up to small constants. We show how our inequality
  can be leveraged to derive a variety of novel, self-normalized concentration inequalities
  under both light and heavy-tailed observations. Further, we provide applications
  in prototypical statistical tasks, such as parameter estimation in online linear
  regression, autoregressive modeling, and bounded mean estimation via a new (multivariate)
  empirical Bernstein concentration inequality. '
