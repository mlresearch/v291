title: Learning Intersections of Two Margin Halfspaces under Factorizable Distributions
section: Original Papers
abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational
  Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question
  whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\gamma$
  of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in
  quasi-polynomial time $d^{O( \log{1/\gamma} )}$, and it has been shown that this
  complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical
  queries (CSQ). In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents  the
  CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of  distributions satisfying
  a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions
  lie between the distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly
  extend previously known tractable cases. For these distributions,  we show that
  CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weak learning. Our
  main result is a learning algorithm for intersections of two margin halfspaces under
  factorizable distributions that  achieves $\text{poly}(d,1/\gamma)$  time by leveraging
  more general statistical queries (SQ). As a corollary, we establish a strong separation
  between CSQ and SQ for this fundamental PAC learning problem.  Our main result is
  grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes
  the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these
  structural insights, our learning algorithm combines a refined variant of Jennrichâ€™s
  Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based
  non-convex optimization framework.
