title: A Distributional-Lifting Theorem for PAC Learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: " The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has
  led to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional assumptions
  facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their reach and relevance.
  Towards addressing this, we prove a {\\sl distributional-lifting theorem}: This
  upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited distribution family $\\mathcal{D}$
  to one that succeeds with respect to {\\sl any} distribution $D^\\star$, with an
  efficiency overhead that scales with the complexity of expressing $D^\\star$ as
  a mixture of distributions in $\\mathcal{D}$.  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik,
  and Tan considered the special case of lifting  uniform-distribution learners and
  designed a lifter that uses a  conditional sample oracle for $D^\\star$, a strong
  form of access not afforded by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws
  on ideas from semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\\star$ and then uses this
  information to lift.  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable
  with access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
  use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that sidesteps
  the need to learn $D^\\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the standard PAC model
  and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base distribution families, preserves
  the noise tolerance of learners, has better sample complexity, and is simpler. "
