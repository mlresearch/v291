title: Robustly Learning Monotone Generalized Linear Models via Data Augmentation
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the task of learning  Generalized Linear models (GLMs) in the agnostic  model
  under the Gaussian distribution.  We give the first polynomial-time  algorithm that
  achieves a constant-factor approximation  for {\em any} monotone Lipschitz activation.  Prior
  constant-factor GLM learners succeed for a substantially  smaller class of activations.  Our
  work resolves a well-known open problem,  by developing a robust counterpart to
  the classical GLMtron algorithm \citep{kakade2011efficient}.   Our robust learner
  applies more generally, encompassing all  monotone activations with bounded $(2+\zeta)$-moments,  for
  any fixed $\zeta>0$—a condition that is  essentially necessary.  To obtain our results,
  we leverage a novel data augmentation technique  with decreasing Gaussian noise
  injection and prove a number  of structural results that may be useful in other
  settings.
