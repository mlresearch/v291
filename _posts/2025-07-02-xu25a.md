section: Original Papers
abstract: 'In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from
  (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions.
  We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this
  model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this
  work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank,
  e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide
  rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance
  from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix.
  Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties
  to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the “Gaussian equivalence” phenomenon
  in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal
  learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors,
  generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works
  on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety
  of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous
  methods from statistical physics in Erba et al. (2024) regarding Bilinear Sequence
  Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in Maillard
  et al. (2024) on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation
  function, and width proportional to the dimension.'
