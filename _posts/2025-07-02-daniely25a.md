title: Existence of Adversarial Examples for Random Convolutional Networks via  Isoperimetric
  Inequalities on $\mathbb{SO}(d)$
section: Original Papers
abstract: We show that adversarial examples exist for various random convolutional
  networks, and furthermore, that this is a relatively simple consequence of the isoperimetric
  inequality on the special orthogonal group $\mathbb{SO}(d)$. This extends and simplifies
  a recent line of work which shows similar results for random fully connected networks.
