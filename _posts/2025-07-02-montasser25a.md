title: 'Beyond Worst-Case Online Classification: VC-Based Regret Bounds for Relaxed
  Benchmarks'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We revisit online binary classification by shifting the focus from competing
  with the best-in-class binary loss to competing against relaxed benchmarks that
  capture smoothed notions of optimality. Instead of measuring regret relative to
  the exact minimal binary error–a standard approach that leads to worst-case bounds
  tied to the Littlestone dimension—we consider comparing with predictors that are
  robust to small input perturbations, perform well under Gaussian smoothing, or maintain
  a prescribed output margin. Previous examples of this were primarily limited to
  the hinge loss. Our algorithms achieve regret guarantees that depend only on the
  VC dimension and the complexity of the instance space (e.g., metric entropy), and
  notably, they incur only an $O(\log(1/\gamma))$ dependence on the generalized margin
  $\gamma$. This stands in contrast to most existing regret bounds, which typically
  exhibit a polynomial dependence on $1/\gamma$. We complement this with matching
  lower bounds. Our analysis connects recent ideas from adversarial robustness and
  smoothed online learning.
