title: Accelerating Proximal Gradient Descent via Silver Stepsizes
section: Original Papers
abstract: Surprisingly, recent work has shown that gradient descent can be accelerated
  without using momentum—just by judiciously choosing stepsizes. An open question
  raised by several papers is whether this phenomenon of stepsize-based acceleration
  holds more generally for constrained and/or composite convex optimization via projected
  and/or proximal versions of gradient descent. We answer this in the affirmative
  by proving that the silver stepsize schedule yields analogously accelerated rates
  in these settings. These rates are conjectured to be asymptotically optimal among
  all stepsize schedules, and match the silver convergence rate of vanilla gradient
  descent (Altschuler and Parrilo, 2024, 2025), namely $O(\varepsilon^{-\log_{\rho}
  2})$ for smooth convex optimization and $O(\kappa^{\log_\rho 2} \log 1/\varepsilon)$
  under strong convexity, where $\varepsilon$ is the precision, $\kappa$ is the condition
  number, and $\rho = 1 + \sqrt{2}$ is the silver ratio. The key technical insight
  is the combination of recursive gluing—the technique underlying all analyses of
  gradient descent accelerated with time-varying stepsizes—with a certain Laplacian-structured
  sum-of-squares certificate for the analysis of proximal point updates.
