title: 'Of Dice and Games: A Theory of Generalized Boosting'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Cost-sensitive loss functions are crucial in many real-world prediction
  problems, where different types of errors are penalized differently; for example,
  in medical diagnosis, a false negative prediction can lead to worse consequences
  than a false positive prediction. However, traditional PAC learning theory has mostly
  focused on the symmetric 0-1 loss, leaving cost-sensitive losses largely unaddressed.
  In this work we extend the celebrated theory of boosting to incorporate both cost-sensitive
  and multi-objective losses. Cost-sensitive losses assign costs to the entries of
  a confusion matrix, and are used to control the sum of prediction errors accounting
  for the cost of each error type. Multi-objective losses, on the other hand, simultaneously
  track multiple cost-sensitive losses, and are useful when the goal is to satisfy
  several criteria at once (e.g., minimizing false positives while keeping false negatives
  below a critical threshold). We develop a comprehensive theory of cost-sensitive
  and multi-objective boosting, providing a taxonomy of weak learning guarantees that
  distinguishes which guarantees are trivial (i.e., can always be achieved), which
  ones are boostable (i.e., imply strong learning), and which ones are intermediate,
  implying non-trivial yet not arbitrarily accurate learning. For binary classification,
  we establish a dichotomy: a weak learning guarantee is either trivial or boostable.
  In the multiclass setting, we describe a more intricate landscape of intermediate
  weak learning guarantees. Our characterization relies on a geometric interpretation
  of boosting, revealing a surprising equivalence between cost-sensitive and multi-objective
  losses.'
