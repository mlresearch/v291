title: Data-dependent Bounds with $T$-Optimal Best-of-Both-Worlds Guarantees in Multi-Armed
  Bandits using Stability-Penalty Matching
section: Original Papers
abstract: " Existing data-dependent and best-of-both-worlds regret bounds for multi-armed
  bandits problems have limited adaptivity as they are either data-dependent but not
  best-of-both-worlds (BOBW), BOBW but not data-dependent or have sub-optimal $O(\\sqrt{T\\ln{T}})$
  worst-case guarantee in the adversarial regime. To overcome these limitations, we
  propose real-time stability-penalty matching (SPM), a new method for obtaining regret
  bounds that are simultaneously data-dependent, best-of-both-worlds and $T$-optimal
  for multi-armed bandits problems. In particular, we show that real-time SPM obtains
  bounds with worst-case guarantees of order $O(\\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial regime
  and $O(\\ln{T})$ in the stochastic regime while simultaneously being adaptive to
  data-dependent quantities such as sparsity, variations, and small losses. Our results
  are obtained by extending the SPM technique for tuning the learning rates in the
  follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) framework, which further indicates that the
  combination of SPM and FTRL is a promising approach for proving new adaptive bounds
  in online learning problems."
