title: 'Open Problem: Optimal Instance-Dependent Sample Complexity for finding Nash
  Equilibrium in Two Player Zero-Sum Matrix games'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'Optimal instance-dependent sample complexity is a well-studied topic in
  the multi-armed bandit literature. However, the analogous question in the setting
  of two-player zero-sum matrix games, where the payoff matrix can only be accessed
  through noisy samples, remains largely unexplored despite being a natural generalization
  of the multi-armed bandit problem.  In this write-up, we pose a simple open question:
  What is the optimal instance-dependent sample complexity to find an approximate
  Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum matrix games?'
