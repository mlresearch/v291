title: Generation through the lens of learning theory
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study generation through the lens of learning theory. First, we formalize
  generation as a sequential two-player game between an adversary and a generator,
  which generalizes the notion of “language generation in the limit” from  Kleinberg
  and Mullainathan (2024). Then, we extend the notion of “generation in the limit"
  to two new settings, which we call “uniform" and “non-uniform" generation. We provide
  a characterization of hypothesis classes that are uniformly and non-uniformly generatable.
  As is standard in learning theory, our characterizations are in terms of the finiteness
  of a new combinatorial dimension termed the Closure dimension. By doing so, we are
  able to compare generatability with predictability (captured via PAC and online
  learnability) and show that these two properties of hypothesis classes are incomparable
  – there are classes that are generatable but not predictable and vice versa. Finally,
  we extend our results to capture prompted generation and give a complete characterization
  of which classes are prompt generatable, generalizing some of the work by  Kleinberg
  and Mullainathan (2024).  '
