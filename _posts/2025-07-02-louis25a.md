title: Robust Algorithms for Recovering Planted $r$-Colorable Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The planted clique problem is a fundamental problem in the study of algorithms
  and has been extensively studied in various random and semirandom models. It is
  known that a clique planted in a random graph can be efficiently recovered if the
  size of the clique is above the conjectured computational threshold of $\Omega_p(\sqrt{n})$.
  A natural question that arises then is: what other planted structures can be efficiently
  recovered? In this work, we investigate this question by considering random planted
  and semirandom models for the $r$-coloring problem. In our model, a subset $S \subseteq
  V$ of size $k$ is chosen, and an arbitrary $r$-colorable graph is planted on the
  subgraph induced by $S$. Edges between pairs in $V \setminus S$ are added independently
  with probability $p$, and an adversary may add arbitrary edges between $S$ and $V
  \setminus S$. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers most
  of the vertices of the planted $r$-colorable graph when $k \geq c r \sqrt{n/p}$,
  for some constant $c$. The key technical contribution is a novel semidefinite programming
  (SDP) relaxation and a rounding algorithm. Our algorithm is also robust to the presence
  of a monotone adversary that can insert edges within $V \setminus S$.'
