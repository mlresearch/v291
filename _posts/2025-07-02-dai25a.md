title: 'Non-Monetary Mechanism Design without Distributional Information: Using Scarce
  Audits Wisely (Extended Abstract)'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study a repeated resource allocation problem with strategic agents where
  monetary transfers are disallowed and the central planner has no prior information
  on agents’ utility distributions. In light of Arrow’s impossibility theorem, acquiring
  information about agent preferences through some form of feedback is necessary.
  We assume that the central planner can request powerful but expensive audits on
  the winner in any round, revealing the true utility of the winner in that round.
  We design a mechanism achieving $T$-independent $\mathcal O(K^2)$ regret in social
  welfare while requesting $\mathcal O(K^3 \log T)$ audits in expectation, where $K$
  is the number of agents and $T$ is the number of rounds. We also show an $\Omega(K)$
  lower bound on the regret and an $\Omega(1)$ lower bound on the number of audits
  when having low regret. Algorithmically, we show that incentive-compatibility can
  be mostly enforced with an accurate estimation of the winning probability of each
  agent under truthful reporting. To do so, we impose future punishments and introduce
  a \emph{flagging} component, allowing agents to flag any biased estimate (we show
  that doing so aligns with individual incentives). On the technical side, without
  monetary transfers and distributional information, the central planner cannot ensure
  that truthful reporting is exactly an equilibrium. Instead, we characterize the
  equilibrium via a reduction to a simpler \emph{auxiliary game}, in which agents
  cannot strategize until late in the $T$ rounds of the allocation problem. The tools
  developed therein may be of independent interest for other mechanism design problems
  in which the revelation principle cannot be readily applied.
