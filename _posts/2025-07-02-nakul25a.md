title: Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency
section: Original Papers
abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an exponentially $\alpha$-mixing
  stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider
  the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution
  of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed
  sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance,
  showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences
  as special cases. Our proposed methodology—implementable in linear time—carefully
  combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification
  of the Good–Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian
  sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance
  bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for  exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic
  processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer
  be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools—including
  concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences—that
  may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related
  problems. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings.
