title: A Polynomial-time Algorithm for Online Sparse Linear Regression with Improved
  Regret Bound under Weaker Conditions
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
  where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
  per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
  polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear independence
  of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted isometry property. We
  introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which significantly improves previous
  regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the compatibility condition that is weaker
  than the other two assumptions. The improvements benefit from a tighter convergence
  rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied
  Dantzig Selector, but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
  sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter tuning
  scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations. We also
  give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for analyzing
  the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of non-independent random
  variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further extend our algorithm to
  OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms can observe additional $k_0$
  attributes after each prediction, and improve previous regret bounds (Kale et al.,
  2017; Ito et al., 2017).
