title: Computational Intractability of Strategizing against Online Learners
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Online learning algorithms are widely used in strategic multi-agent settings,
  including repeated auctions, contract design, and pricing competitions, where agents
  adapt their strategies over time. A key question in such environments is how an
  optimizing agent can best respond to a learning agent to improve its own long-term
  outcomes. While prior work has developed efficient algorithms for the optimizer
  in special cases—such as structured auction settings or contract design—no general
  efficient algorithm is known.   In this paper, we establish a strong computational
  hardness result: unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$, no polynomial-time optimizer
  can compute a near-optimal strategy against a learner using a standard no-regret
  algorithm, specifically Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU). Our result proves an
  $\Omega(T)$ hardness bound, significantly strengthening previous work that only
  showed an additive $\Theta(1)$ impossibility result. Furthermore, while the prior
  hardness result focused on learners using fictitious play—an algorithm that is not
  no-regret—we prove intractability for a widely used no-regret learning algorithm.
  This establishes a fundamental computational barrier to finding optimal strategies
  in general game-theoretic settings.  '
