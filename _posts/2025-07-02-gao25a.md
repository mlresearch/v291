title: Gradient Methods with Online Scaling
section: Original Papers
abstract: We introduce a framework to accelerate the convergence of gradient-based
  methods with online learning. The framework learns to scale the gradient at each
  iteration through an online learning algorithm and provably accelerates gradient-based
  methods asymptotically. In contrast with previous literature, where convergence
  is established based on worst-case analysis, our framework provides a strong convergence
  guarantee with respect to the optimal stepsize for the iteration trajectory. For
  smooth strongly convex optimization, our framework provides an $\Ocal(\kappa^\star
  \log(1/\varepsilon)$) asymptotic complexity result, where $\kappa^\star$ is the
  condition number achievable by the optimal preconditioner, improving on the previous
  $\Ocal(\sqrt{n}\kappa^\star \log(1/\varepsilon))$ result. For smooth convex optimization,
  we obtain the first convergence guarantee for the widely used hypergradient descent
  heuristic.
