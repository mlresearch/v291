title: Partial and Exact Recovery of a Random Hypergraph from its Graph Projection
section: Original Papers
abstract: Consider a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges
  are included iid so that the average degree is $n^\delta$. The projection of a hypergraph
  is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only
  if they belong to some hyperedge. The goal is to reconstruct the hypergraph given
  its projection. An earlier work of Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024) showed
  that exact recovery for $d=3$ is possible if and only if $\delta < 2/5$. This work
  completely resolves the question for all values of $d$ for both exact and partial
  recovery and for both cases of whether multiplicity information about each edge
  is available or not. In addition, we show that the reconstruction fidelity undergoes
  an all-or-nothing transition at a threshold. In particular, this resolves all conjectures
  from Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024).
