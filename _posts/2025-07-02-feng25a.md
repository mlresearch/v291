title: Approximating the total variation distance between spin systems
section: Original Papers
abstract: Spin systems form an important class of undirected graphical models. For
  two Gibbs distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ induced by two spin systems on the same
  graph $G = (V, E)$, we study the problem of approximating the total variation distance
  $d_{\mathrm{TV}}\left({\mu},{\nu}\right)$ with an $\epsilon$-relative error. We
  propose a new reduction that connects the problem of approximating the TV-distance
  to sampling and approximate counting. Our applications include the hardcore model
  and the antiferromagnetic Ising model in the uniqueness regime, the ferromagnetic
  Ising model, and the general Ising model satisfying the spectral condition.  Additionally,
  we explore the computational complexity of approximating the total variation distance
  $d_{\mathrm{TV}}\left({\mu_S},{\nu_S}\right)$ between two marginal distributions
  on an arbitrary subset $S \subseteq V$. We prove that this problem remains hard
  even when both $\mu$ and $\nu$ admit polynomial-time sampling and approximate counting
  algorithms.
