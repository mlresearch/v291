title: Online Covariance Estimation in Nonsmooth Stochastic Approximation
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider applying stochastic approximation (SA) methods to solve nonsmooth
  variational inclusion problems. Existing studies have shown that the averaged iterates
  of SA methods exhibit asymptotic normality, with an optimal limiting covariance
  matrix in the local minimax sense of  Hájek and Le Cam. However, no methods have
  been proposed to estimate this covariance matrix in a nonsmooth and potentially
  non-monotone (nonconvex) setting.  In this paper, we study an online batch-means
  covariance matrix estimator introduced in  Zhu et al. (2023). The estimator groups
  the SA iterates appropriately and computes the sample covariance among batches as
  an estimate of the limiting covariance. Its construction does not require prior
  knowledge of the total sample size, and updates can be performed recursively as
  new data arrives. We establish that, as long as the batch size sequence is properly
  specified (depending on the stepsize sequence), the estimator achieves a convergence
  rate of order $O(\sqrt{d}n^{-1/8+\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, where $d$
  and $n$ denote the problem dimensionality and the number of iterations (or samples)
  used. Although the problem is nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex),
  our convergence rate matches the best-known rate for covariance estimation methods
  using only first-order information in smooth and strongly-convex settings. The consistency
  of this covariance estimator enables asymptotically valid statistical inference,
  including constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis testing.
