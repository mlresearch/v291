title: Exploring Facets of Language Generation in the Limit
section: Original Papers
abstract: " The recent work of Kleinberg and Mullainathan provides a concrete model
  for language generation in the limit: given a sequence of examples from an unknown
  target language, the goal is to generate new examples from the target language such
  that no incorrect examples are generated beyond some point. In sharp contrast to
  strong negative results for the closely related problem of language identification,
  \ they establish positive results for language generation in the limit for all countable
  collections of languages. Follow-up work by Li, Raman and Tewari studies bounds
  on the number of distinct inputs required by an algorithm before correct language
  generation is achieved â€” namely, whether this is a constant for all languages in
  the collection (uniform generation) or a language-dependent constant (non-uniform
  generation). We show that every countable collection has a generator with the stronger
  property of non-uniform generation in the limit. However, while the generation algorithm
  of Kleinberg and Mullainathan can be implemented using membership queries, we show
  that any algorithm cannot non-uniformly generate even for collections of just two
  languages, using only membership queries. We also formalize the tension between
  validity and breadth in the generation algorithm of Kleinberg and Mullainathan by
  introducing a definition of exhaustive generation, and show a strong negative result
  for exhaustive generation. Our result shows that a tradeoff between validity and
  breadth is inherent for generation in the limit. We also provide a precise characterization
  of the language collections for which exhaustive generation is possible. Finally,
  inspired by algorithms that can choose to obtain feedback, we consider a model of
  uniform generation with feedback, completely characterizing language collections
  for which such uniform generation with feedback is possible in terms of an abstract
  complexity measure of the collection. "
