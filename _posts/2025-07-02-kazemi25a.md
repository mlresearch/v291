title: The Sample Complexity of Distributed Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing under
  Information Constraints
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'This paper resolves two open problems from a recent paper (Pensia et al.,
  2024b) concerning the sample complexity of distributed simple binary hypothesis
  testing under information constraints. The first open problem asks whether interaction
  reduces the sample complexity of distributed simple binary hypothesis testing. In
  this paper, we show that sequential interaction does not help. The second problem
  suggests tightening existing sample complexity bounds for communication-constrained
  simple binary hypothesis testing. We derive optimally tight bounds for this setting
  and resolve this problem. Our main technical contributions are: (i) a one-shot lower
  bound on the Bayes error in simple binary hypothesis testing that satisfies a crucial
  tensorisation property; (ii) a streamlined proof of the formula for the sample complexity
  of simple binary hypothesis testing without constraints, first established in (Pensia
  et al., 2024b); and (iii) a reverse data-processing inequality for Hellinger-$\lambda$
  divergences, generalising the results from Bhatt et al.(2021) and Pensia et al.
  (2023).'
