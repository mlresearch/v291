title: Identifiability and Estimation in High-Dimensional Nonparametric Latent Structure
  Models
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper studies the problems of identifiability and estimation in high-dimensional
  nonparametric latent structure models. We introduce an identifiability theorem that
  generalizes existing conditions, establishing a unified framework applicable to
  diverse statistical settings.  Our results rigorously demonstrate how increased
  dimensionality, coupled with diversity in variables, inherently facilitates identifiability.
  For the estimation problem, we establish near-optimal minimax rate bounds for the
  high-dimensional nonparametric density estimation under latent structures with smooth
  marginals. Contrary to the conventional curse of dimensionality, our sample complexity
  scales only polynomially with the dimension. Additionally, we develop a perturbation
  theory for component recovery and propose a recovery procedure based on simultaneous
  diagonalization.
