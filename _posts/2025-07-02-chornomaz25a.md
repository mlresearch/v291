title: Spherical Dimension
section: Original Papers
abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{spherical dimension}, a natural topological
  relaxation of the VC dimension that unifies several results in learning theory where
  topology plays a key role in the proofs. The spherical dimension is defined by extending
  the set of realizable datasets (used to define the VC dimension) to the continuous
  space of realizable distributions. In this space, a shattered set of size d (in
  the VC sense) is completed into a continuous object, specifically a d-dimensional
  sphere of realizable distributions. The spherical dimension is then defined as the
  dimension of the largest sphere in this space. Thus, the spherical dimension is
  at least the VC dimension.  The spherical dimension serves as a common foundation
  for leveraging the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and related topological tools. We demonstrate
  the utility of the spherical dimension in diverse applications, including disambiguations
  of partial concept classes, reductions from classification to stochastic convex
  optimization, stability and replicability, and sample compression schemes. Perhaps
  surprisingly, we show that the open question posed by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and
  Moran (FOCS 2021) of whether there exist non-trivial disambiguations for halfspaces
  with margin is equivalent to the basic open question of whether the VC and spherical
  dimensions are finite together.
