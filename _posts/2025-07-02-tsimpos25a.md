title: Optimal Scheduling of Dynamic Transport
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time
  dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure
  to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design
  freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular
  methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here
  that a specific class of “curved” trajectories can significantly improve approximation
  and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given
  transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the
  spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t
  \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation
  error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class
  of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can
  be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is
  \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule  (corresponding
  to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic).  Our proof technique relies on the
  calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the
  aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.'
