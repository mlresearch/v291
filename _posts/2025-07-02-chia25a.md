title: Quantum State and Unitary Learning Implies Circuit Lower Bounds
section: Original Papers
abstract: We establish connections between state tomography, pseudorandomness, quantum
  state synthesis, and circuit lower bounds. In particular, let $\mathfrak C $ be
  a family of non-uniform quantum circuits of polynomial size and suppose that there
  exists an algorithm that, given copies of $\ket \psi$, distinguishes whether $\ket
  \psi$ is produced by $\mathfrak C$ or is Haar random, promised one of these is the
  case. For arbitrary fixed constant $c$, we show that if the algorithm uses at most
  $O\!\left(2^{n^c}\right)$ time and $2^{n^{0.99}}$ samples then $\mathsf{stateBQE}
  \not\subset \mathsf{state}\mathfrak{C}$. Here $\mathsf{stateBQE} \coloneqq \mathsf{stateBQTIME}\left[2^{O(n)}\right]$
  and $\mathsf{state}\mathfrak{C}$ are state synthesis complexity classes as introduced
  by Rosenthal and Yuen (2022), which capture problems with classical inputs but quantum
  output. Note that efficient tomography implies a similarly efficient distinguishing
  algorithm against Haar random states, even for nearly exponential-time algorithms.
  Because every state produced by a polynomial-size circuit can be learned with $2^{O(n)}$
  samples and time, or $\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ samples and $2^{\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))}$
  time, we show that even slightly non-trivial quantum state tomography algorithms
  would lead to new statements about quantum state synthesis. Finally, a slight modification
  of our proof shows that distinguishing algorithms for quantum states can imply circuit
  lower bounds for decision problems as well. We then take these results and port
  them over to the setting of unitary learning and unitary synthesis. All combined,
  this helps shed light on why time-efficient tomography algorithms for non-uniform
  quantum circuit classes has only had limited and partial progress. Our work extends
  the results of Arunachalam et. al. (2022), which revealed a connection between quantum
  learning of \emph{Boolean functions} and circuit lower bounds for \emph{classical}
  circuit classes, to the setting of state (resp. unitary) tomography and state (resp.
  unitary) synthesis. As a result, we establish a conditional pseudorandom state (resp.
  unitary) generator, a circuit size hierarchy theorems for non-uniform state (resp.
  unitary) synthesis, and connections between state (resp. unitary) synthesis class
  separations and decision class separations, which may be of independent interest.
