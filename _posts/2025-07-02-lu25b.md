title: Sample Efficient Omniprediction and Downstream Swap Regret for Non-Linear Losses
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We define “decision swap regret” which generalizes both prediction for
  downstream swap regret and omniprediction, and give algorithms for obtaining it
  for arbitrary multi-dimensional Lipschitz loss functions in online adversarial settings.
  We also give sample complexity bounds in the batch setting via an online-to-batch
  reduction. When applied to omniprediction, our algorithm gives the first polynomial
  sample-complexity bounds for Lipschitz loss functions—prior bounds either applied
  only to linear loss (or binary outcomes) or scaled exponentially with the error
  parameter even under the assumption that the loss functions were convex.  When applied
  to prediction for downstream regret, we give the first algorithm capable of guaranteeing
  swap regret bounds for all downstream agents with non-linear loss functions over
  a multi-dimensional outcome space: prior work applied only to linear loss functions,
  modeling risk neutral agents. Our general bounds scale exponentially with the dimension
  of the outcome space, but we give improved regret and sample complexity bounds for
  specific families of multidimensional functions of economic interest: constant elasticity
  of substitution (CES), Cobb-Douglas, and Leontief utility functions.'
