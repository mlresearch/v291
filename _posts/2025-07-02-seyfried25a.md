title: Testing (Conditional) Mutual Information - Extended Abstract
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We investigate the sample complexity of mutual information and conditional
  mutual information testing. For conditional mutual information testing, given access
  to independent samples of a triple of random variables $(A, B, C)$ with unknown
  distribution, we want to distinguish between two cases: (i) $A$ and $C$ are conditionally
  independent, i.e., $I(A:C|B) = 0$, and (ii) $A$ and $C$ are conditionally dependent,
  i.e., $I(A:C|B) \geq \varepsilon$ for some threshold $\varepsilon$. We establish
  an upper bound on the number of samples required to distinguish between the two
  cases with high confidence, as a function of $\varepsilon$ and the three alphabet
  sizes. We conjecture that our bound is tight and show that this is indeed the case
  in several parameter regimes. For the special case of mutual information testing
  (when $B$ is trivial), we establish the necessary and sufficient number of samples
  required up to polylogarithmic terms.  Our technical contributions include a novel
  method to efficiently simulate weakly correlated samples from the conditionally
  independent distribution $P_{A|B} P_{C|B} P_B$ given access to samples from an unknown
  distribution $P_{ABC}$, and a new estimator for equivalence testing that can handle
  such correlated samples, which might be of independent interest.'
