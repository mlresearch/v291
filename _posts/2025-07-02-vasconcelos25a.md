title: Learning shallow quantum circuits with many-qubit gates
section: Original Papers
abstract: The seminal work of [LMN’93] established a cornerstone result for classical
  complexity, with profound implications for learning theory. By proving low-degree
  Fourier concentration of AC0, the work demonstrated that Boolean functions computed
  by constant-depth circuits can be efficiently PAC-learned via low-degree Fourier
  sampling. This breakthrough provided the first sample- and time-efficient (quasi-polynomial)
  algorithm for learning AC0.  Proposed by [Moore’99] as a natural quantum analog
  of AC0, QAC0 is the class of constant-depth quantum circuits composed of arbitrary
  single-qubit gates and polynomial $CZ$ gates of unbounded width. In this work, we
  present the first algorithm for efficient average-case learning of QAC0 circuits
  with logarithmic ancilla. Namely, our algorithm achieves quasi-polynomial sample-
  and time-complexity for learning unknown QAC0 unitaries to inverse-polynomially
  small error. We further show that these learned unitaries can be efficiently synthesized
  via poly-logarithmic depth circuits, making progress towards proper learning of
  QAC0. Since in finite-dimensional circuit geometries QAC0 circuits require polynomial
  depth to implement, this result significantly expands the family of efficiently
  learnable quantum circuits.
