title: Faster Low-Rank Approximation and Kernel Ridge Regression via the Block-Nyström
  Method
section: Original Papers
abstract: The Nyström method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large
  matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the data
  exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the problem often
  becomes so large that even the Nyström method may be outside of our computational
  budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nyström, an algorithm that injects a block-diagonal
  structure into the Nyström method, thereby significantly reducing its computational
  cost while recovering strong approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nyström
  can be used to construct improved preconditioners for second-order optimization,
  as well as to efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning
  over Hilbert spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational
  budget, combining several smaller Nyström approximations leads to stronger tail
  estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along the way,
  we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently inverting the
  Block-Nyström matrix, and provide new statistical learning bounds for a broad class
  of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.
