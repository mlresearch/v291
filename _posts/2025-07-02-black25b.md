title: Learning Partitions with Optimal Query and Round Complexities
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$ elements
  into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information about a small
  subset of elements. Our starting point is the popular and well-studied pairwise
  \emph{same-set} queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same class.
  It is well-known that non-adaptive (fully parallel) algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$
  queries, while adaptive (fully sequential) algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries,
  and the best known algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds of adaptivity. Many variations of
  this problem have been studied over the last two decades in multiple disciplines
  due to its fundamental nature and connections to clustering, active learning, and
  crowd-sourcing. In many of these applications, it is of paramount interest to reduce
  adaptivity, a.k.a the number of rounds, while minimizing the query complexity. In
  this paper, we give a complete characterization of the deterministic query complexity
  of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$, which interpolates smoothly
  between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant $r \geq 1$, the
  query complexity is $\smash{\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})}$.
  Additionally, our algorithm only needs $O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal
  $O(nk)$ query complexity, which is a double-exponential improvement over prior works
  when $k$ is a polynomial in $n$. Next, we consider two natural generalizations of
  pair-wise queries to general subsets $S$ of size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries
  which return the number of classes intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries
  which return the entire partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing
  applications, queries on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms,
  we show $\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. In contrast, perhaps surprisingly,
  we show that there is a non-adaptive randomized algorithm using weak queries that
  matches this bound up to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally,
  we obtain nearly matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using weak and strong
  queries in terms of both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.'
