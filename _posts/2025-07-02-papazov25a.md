title: Learning Algorithms in the Limit
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
  by extending Goldâ€™s inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational
  observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional
  Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory
  Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more
  realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning
  the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning
  barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
  time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations
  of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from
  policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output,
  thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference.
  On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic
  sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory
  observations.
