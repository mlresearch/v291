title: Data Selection for ERMs
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Learning theory has traditionally followed a model-centric approach, focusing
  on designing optimal algorithms for a fixed natural learning task (e.g., linear
  classification or regression). In this paper, we adopt a complementary data-centric
  perspective, whereby we fix a natural learning rule and focus on optimizing the
  training data. Specifically, we study the following question: given a learning rule
  $\mathcal{A}$ and a data selection budget $n$, how well can $\mathcal{A}$ perform
  when trained on at most $n$ data points selected from a population of $N$ points?
  We investigate when it is possible to select $n \ll N$ points and achieve performance
  comparable to training on the entire population. We address this question across
  a variety of empirical risk minimizers. Our results include optimal data-selection
  bounds for mean estimation, linear classification, and linear regression. Additionally,
  we establish two general results: a taxonomy of error rates in binary classification
  and in stochastic convex optimization. Finally, we propose several open questions
  and directions for future research.'
