title: 'Open Problem: Structure-Agnostic Minimax Risk for Partial Linear Model'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'Double machine learning is a theoretically grounded and practically efficient
  procedure for a variety of causal estimands and functional estimation problems when
  adopting black-box machine learning models for estimating nuisance parameters. It
  is known that double machine learning may have sub-optimal performance in the structure-aware
  settings, e.g., the nuisances are H{ö}lder smooth functions, and recent articles
  (Balakrishnan et al., 2023) are delivering the message that double machine learning
  is optimal in structure-agnostic settings. This note claims that whether double
  machine learning is optimal for black-box machine learning models remains open,
  even for the simplest linear coefficient estimation in the partial linear model.
  We argue that the key gap that differentiates structure-agnostic and structure-aware
  settings, and also the previous lower bound results do not address, is the role
  of variance – the awareness of well-conditioned structures offers the possibility
  to mitigate the effects of variance, while that is not clear for structure-agnostic
  settings. The answer to this question has significant implications both in theory
  and practice. '
