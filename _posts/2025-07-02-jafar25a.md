title: Local Regularizers Are Not Transductive Learners
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We partly resolve an open question raised by Asilis et al. 2024: whether
  the algorithmic template of local regularization — an intriguing generalization
  of explicit regularization, a.k.a. structural risk minimization — suffices to learn
  all learnable multiclass problems. Specifically, we provide a negative answer to
  this question in the transductive model of learning. We exhibit a multiclass classification
  problem which is learnable in both the transductive and PAC models, yet cannot be
  learned transductively by any local regularizer. The corresponding hypothesis class,
  and our proof, are based on principles from cryptographic secret sharing. We outline
  challenges in extending our negative result to the PAC model, leaving open the tantalizing
  possibility of a PAC/transductive separation with respect to local regularization.'
