title: Differentially Private Synthetic Graphs Preserving Triangle-Motif Cuts
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of releasing a differentially private (DP) synthetic
  graph $G’$ that well approximates the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts of any given
  graph $G$, where a motif in general refers to a frequently occurring subgraph within
  complex networks. Non-private versions of such graphs have found applications in
  diverse fields such as graph clustering, graph sparsification, and social network
  analysis. Specifically, we present the first $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism
  that, given an input graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and local sensitivity
  of triangles $\ell_{3}(G)$, generates a synthetic graph $G’$ in polynomial time,
  approximating the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts $(S,V\setminus S)$ of the input
  graph $G$ up to an additive error of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m\ell_3(G)}n/\varepsilon^{3/2})$.
  Additionally, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{mn}\ell_3(G)/\varepsilon)$
  on the additive error for any DP algorithm that answers the triangle-motif size
  queries of all $(S,T)$-cut of $G$. Finally, our algorithm generalizes to weighted
  graphs, and our lower bound extends to any $K_h$-motif cut for any constant $h\geq
  2$.
