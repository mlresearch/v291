title: Computable learning of natural hypothesis classes
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper is about the recent notion of computably probably approximately
  correct learning, which lies between the statistical learning theory where there
  is no computational requirement on the learner and efficient PAC learning where
  the learner must be polynomially bounded. Examples have recently been given of hypothesis
  classes which are PAC-learnable but not computably PAC-learnable, but these hypothesis
  classes can be viewed as unnatural or non-canonical. We use the on-a-cone machinery
  from computability theory to prove that, under certain assumptions on the hypothesis
  class, any “natural” hypothesis class which is learnable must be computably learnable.
