title: On the Convergence of Min-Max Langevin Dynamics and Algorithm
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study zero-sum games in the space of probability distributions over
  the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with entropy regularization, in the setting when
  the interaction function between the players is smooth and strongly convex-strongly
  concave. We prove an exponential convergence guarantee for the mean-field min-max
  Langevin dynamics to compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game.
  We also study the finite-particle approximation of the mean-field min-max Langevin
  dynamics, both in continuous and discrete times. We prove biased convergence guarantees
  for the continuous-time finite-particle min-max Langevin dynamics to the stationary
  mean-field equilibrium distribution with an explicit bias term which does not scale
  with the number of particles. We also prove biased convergence guarantees for the
  discrete-time finite-particle min-max Langevin algorithm to the stationary mean-field
  equilibrium distribution with an additional bias term which scales with the step
  size and the number of particles. This provides an explicit iteration complexity
  for the average particle along the finite-particle algorithm to approximately compute
  the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game. '
