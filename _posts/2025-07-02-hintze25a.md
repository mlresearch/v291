title: 'Noisy Group Testing in the Linear Regime: Exact Thresholds and Efficient '
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups
  of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each
  item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other
  items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if
  any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which
  observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive
  or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise
  constantsÂ $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status
  of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former,
  the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results,
  whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient
  algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with
  high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing
  in the studied setting.'
