title: Testing Juntas and Junta Subclasses with Relative Error
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'This paper considers the junta testing problem in a recently introduced
  “relative error” variant of the standard Boolean function property testing model.
  In relative-error testing we measure the distance from $f$ to $g$, where $f,g: \{0,1\}^n
  \to \{0,1\}$, by the ratio of $|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|$ (the number of inputs
  on which $f$ and $g$ disagree) to $|f^{-1}(1)|$ (the number of satisfying assignments
  of $f$), and we give the testing algorithm both black-box access to $f$ and also  access
  to independent uniform samples from $f^{-1}(1)$.   Chen et al. (SODA 2025) observed
  that the class of $k$-juntas is poly$(2^k,1/\epsilon)$-query testable in the relative-error
  model, and asked whether poly$(k,1/\epsilon)$ queries is achievable.  We answer
  this question affirmatively by giving a $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$-query algorithm,
  matching the optimal complexity achieved in the less challenging standard model.  Moreover,
  as our main result, we show that any subclass of $k$-juntas that is closed under
  permuting variables is relative-error testable with a similar complexity.  This
  gives highly efficient relative-error testing algorithms for a number of well-studied
  function classes, including size-$k$ decision trees, size-$k$ branching programs,
  and size-$k$ Boolean formulas.'
