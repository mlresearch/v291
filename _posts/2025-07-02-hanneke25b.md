title: Universal Rates of ERM for Agnostic Learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The universal learning framework has been developed to obtain guarantees
  on the learning rates that hold for any fixed distribution, which can be much faster
  than the ones uniformly hold over all the distributions. Given that the Empirical
  Risk Minimization (ERM) principle being fundamental in the PAC theory and ubiquitous
  in practical machine learning, the recent work of Hanneke and Xu (2024) studied
  the universal rates of ERM for binary classification under the realizable setting.
  However, the assumption of realizability is too restrictive to hold in practice.
  Indeed, the majority of the literature on universal learning has focused on the
  realizable case, leaving the non-realizable case barely explored. In this paper,
  we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM for binary classification under
  the agnostic setting, where the ‚Äùlearning curve" reflects the decay of the excess
  risk as the sample size increases. We explore the possibilities of agnostic universal
  rates and reveal a compact trichotomy: there are three possible agnostic universal
  rates of ERM, being either exponential, super-root, or arbitrarily slow. We provide
  a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories.
  Moreover, we also establish complete characterizations for the target-dependent
  universal rates as well as the Bayes-dependent universal rates.'
