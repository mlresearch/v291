title: 'PREM: Privately Answering Statistical Queries with Relative Error'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We introduce $\mathsf{PREM}$ (Private Relative Error Multiplicative weight
  update), a new framework for generating synthetic data that achieves a {\em relative}
  error guarantee for statistical queries under $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential
  privacy (DP). Namely, for a domain ${\cal X}$, a family ${\cal F}$ of queries $f
  : {\cal X} \to \{0, 1\}$, and $\zeta > 0$, our framework yields a mechanism that
  on input dataset $D \in {\cal X}^n$ outputs a synthetic dataset $\widehat{D} \in
  {\cal X}^n$ such that all statistical queries in ${\cal F}$ on $D$, namely $\sum_{x
  \in D} f(x)$ for $f \in {\cal F}$, are within a $1 \pm \zeta$ {\em multiplicative}
  factor of the corresponding value on $\widehat{D}$ up to an {\em additive} error
  that is polynomial in $\log |{\cal F}|$, $\log |{\cal X}|$, $\log n$, $\log(1/\delta)$,
  $1/\varepsilon$, and $1/\zeta$. In contrast, any $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP mechanism
  is known to require worst-case additive error that is polynomial in at least one
  of $n, |{\cal F}|$, or $|{\cal X}|$. We complement our algorithm with nearly matching
  lower bounds.'
