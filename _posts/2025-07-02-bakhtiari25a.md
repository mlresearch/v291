title: Thompson Sampling for Bandit Convex Optimisation
section: Original Papers
abstract: " We show that Thompson sampling has a Bayesian regret of at most $\\tilde
  O(\\sqrt{n})$ for $1$-dimensional bandit convex optimisation where $n$ is the time
  horizon and no assumptions are made on the loss function beyond convexity, boundedness
  and a mild Lipschitz assumption. For general high-dimensional problems we show that
  Thompson sampling can fail catastrophically. More positively,  we show that Thompson
  sampling has Bayesian regret of $\\tilde O(d^{2.5} \\sqrt{n})$ for generalised linear
  bandits with an unknown convex monotone link function. Lastly, we prove that the
  standard information-theoretic machinery can never give a bound on the regret in
  the general case that improveson the best known bound of $\\tilde O(d^{1.5} \\sqrt{n})$. "
